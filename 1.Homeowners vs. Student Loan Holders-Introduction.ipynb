    "The marketing team at WAU Bank would like to better target their audience to promote advertisements on various forums that are more appropriate to the target audience. Using Natural Language Processing on Reddit I will be creating a Classification Model to distinguish between the r/HomeImprovement and r/StudentLoan subreddits. This model could be usable on other bodies of text to determine whether the user may be in a state of homeownership or student debt and whether to market Home Equity Loans or Mortgages to those users.

    "# Outside Research\n",
    "A cooperative study by American Student Assistance and the National Association of Realtors shows that only 20% of people with student loans are homeowners while 84% of them are employed full time. This is a great opportunity to identify a market that will likely be looking to buy a house in the near future and have a college degree and full time job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bankrate conducted a Survey which showed that 57% of homeowners who are planning a home improvement are planning on using a credit card to finanance their project while only 11% are planning on using a loan. This an excellent opportunity to tap a market that seems to be overpaying for financing by targeting them with Home Equity Loans or Home Equity Lines of Credit(HELOC)."
