nd2483,What is the best way to fix these ceiling paint lines?,"I bought a new place and a family member offered to hire their neighbor, who is a painter by trade and does side jobs, to do the work. I can't say it was the best experience. For instance, he walked by a door with dark paint on the brush and now there is dark paint on the white door or he touched up an area above a rocker switch without taping the switch and now there is paint in the nooks and crannies of the switch...things like that. 

Anyhow, the ceiling lines in the bedroom drive me crazy.

nd1qpw,Basement 2 project- to dig out or not?,"[https://imgur.com/a/m3DZ5nA](https://imgur.com/a/m3DZ5nA)

We are scoping out a crawlspace dig out project.  Our budget is under $100k, and initial research says this will cost around $60k.  Location is near Washington DC.  We don't want to put another structure on our property ( the cheaper option for us), and just want to know what to expect.  This area is underneath an addition to the house.  House was built in the 50's, addition was probably built in the 70's.  There is no apparent piering in the middle of this crawlspace, so it will be a nice, open space, about 12x25 in dimension.  

Anyone else done this?  The ending result will be a band rehearsal space, so it does not have to be pretty.  All concrete floor and walls is absolutely fine.  Will do some block filler painting of any concrete walls, and probably some soundproofing, but that will be after we have a structural solution in place.  Happy to put in a sump pump if this makes a difference.  

The space will need to be clean and waterproof- what can I do to prevent that from being an issue?  Power will be (relatively) easy to get into that room, and I'm planning on putting in a ductless system for ac/heat needs.",1,1,HomeImprovement,1192

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/wYjxpu7) are the pictures.

The drain is in the bottom left of the second picture, but water collects and stagnates in pretty much all of the first picture.  This picture was taken after 4 days of dry weather, so you can see how it collects and doesn't dry out for days.  The wall around it are 8-9 feet high so it doesn't get much direct sunlight.

We didn't use the back garden much as it was a steep hill you couldn't even put furniture on, but having just had it landscaped we now need access through this area to use it.  Having to step in a wet muddy puddle before going back into the house isn't ideal.  

Is there a way to help the drainage without ripping out and repouring the concrete?  Drilling holes through at the higher low points?  Adding another drain in?  Gravel/deck the area?

nd1cfd,Redoing stairway to basement. Proper method for newel post?,"Hi all. I'm redoing my basement and currently am on the home stretch. We have a hefty piece of wood about 6 in by 7 in from a wood reclaiming company (pretty certain this particular piece came from a barn of some sort). We'd like to purpose it as the newel post for bottom of steps.

The floor is all concrete, and this piece of wood is quite hefty. This adds a bit to my concern of stability over time. I've dug into the methods to attach it to the bottom of the stairway framing but I can't help but to question if that's enough. I've considered cutting a hole slightly larger than the post into the floor so I could effectively sink it in to the floor a bit for added stability. My thinking was cut the hole, drop the post in place, secure it until level to the stairway frame, and then backfill the hole with some sort of concrete or other filler if there's a better option.

Now of course it's against code to have exposed wood against concrete unless it's treated. I can't speak to the history of this wood in particular. It seems like some folks in a similar position have gravitated to wrapping the bottom of the post in plastic so it can be a barrier against the concrete. I've read that you want at least 10 mil thickness of plastic for this. I'm assuming it'd be a matter of wrapping the post, doing everything else, and then cutting the plastic flush/slightly above the floor level and finish up with the flooring/trim/etc that would further hide any tiny extra left over?

I suppose I have two main questions here really. If I go this route, is any sort of 10 mil+ plastic enough or should I focus on finding a specific 'kind' of plastic? I wasn't sure if there was some sort of product that caters more specifically to being within concrete slabs.k

Beyond that, is some sort of quikrete the go-to for the backfill? I saw one post that mentioned some sort of hydraulic cement sealer but I wasn't familiar with that particular product (when I hear ""sealer"" I think very paint-like and less like something that would backfill a notable hole such as what this project would be doing).

We had bought a townhouse a few months ago and have been running through some of the items that the inspector had called out. Unfortunately, as the weather has gotten warmer we have had an issue with mice in the home. I've went around the perimeter of the home and sealed gaps with Duct Seal (AC line) and Rid-O-Mice (weep holes) as well as setting traps around, but problem I see is behind our range. After sliding it out, I saw a lot of mouse poop, and a noticeable gap between where the baseboard was removed under the outlet, and the tile floor. Not only that, but there are holes in the outlet itself. My suspicion is that this is a potential entry point.

I bought picture hangers that were supposedly designed for plaster walls (here's what they look like - https://ibb.co/f19m5vS), but it said in the instructions to hammer the nails in, and with plaster I know that's a no-no. So I drilled some shallow pilot holes and then tried to hammer them in the rest of the way. However, when I got to a certain point my drill gave a lot of resistance and when I tried hammering, the nails started to bend. So I am assuming I hit brick or a stud or something, but my friend warned me about hitting gas pipes in older homes. I'm a hypochondriac and now I am worried I could have drilled into a pipe of some kind, even though I know I'd probably have to go pretty deep to hit something like that? It did release a bit of a funky odor for a couple seconds when I drilled but that's probably just the smell of old, old plaster. 😂 I didn't smell any kind of gas.

ncz2mh,Lightweight no drill fixture for 150yo sandstone walls?," Hi there

I'd like to attach some fixtures to train a plant along wires outside my 1880's house which is built from sandstone. The idea is that the plant is visible from the inside so the wires will go along the inner part of the window bay (the windows are in recess).

As you can imagine, it's quite crumbly, even moreso because it's the south facing one. I can't/won't drill under any circumstances. The plant (clematis) is very lightweight and safety isn't an issue, so I was thinking to experiment with some kind of mortar. However they all recommend a clean and dust-free base, which by nature sandstone never is. Stone glue could be an option but it shouldn't chemically damage the wall (eg with a low pH).

ncyntf,Hello and wooden fence replacement question.,"Hello all. I have a typical wooden privacy fence around my back yard, 3 sides then the small sections against either side of the house. One side was replaced in full by my neighbor about a year ago. In his words, he was “retired and had money” so he didn’t ask for anything. The other I’m on good terms with the neighbor and we’ll work together to replace. 
My back fence was built when the house behind me was built, about 12-13 years ago. I had nothing to do with its construction, but it is rotting away. Pickets fall off all the time, and the cross beams are rotted too much to re-install pickets when they fall. I have met that back neighbor, and he believes since I have the flat side, it’s all my responsibility to repair. He mentioned many times that he’s a disabled vet and can’t do the work which is fine, but I did hope he would split costs. But he heavily implied he won’t. I will ask him once more to help with costs once i actually start, but doesn’t sound like he will, and I’m not in the mood for a fight.
So, I plan to start at one end and repair a section at a time as I can. 
Here’s the question-I thought I might go ahead and get the 2x3 cross bars for the entire run and install them while I have the first section down. I’d just put them above the old ones, attached to the metal poles, but not to the old pickets unless a temporary repair is needed. This would let me only need to go in his yard once, have a way to repair further pickets that may fall, etc. Is there any issue to putting these in ahead of time above the old ones? It means they’ll be slightly higher, but I was going to raise the fence just a tad anyway to get it off the ground. I’ll probably upgrade to pressure treated if I can afford it. Just didn’t know if I would face any issues having them installed ahead of time against the old fence.

ncx12u,Is hardwood flooring worth it or over-hyped?,">TLDR:   
Is hardwood really all it's hyped up to be? If it depends on circumstances what are the deciding factors? If not hardwood, then what?

  
I've got a mix of carpet, laminate, LVT, and not very ice hardwood (foyer only) in my first floor today.  


I'm looking to redo the floors and have settled on  getting just 2 flooring types: Tile for the ""wet"" areas,  but I'm unsure for the second.  


It seems like everyone I know is saying that hardwood is the nicest flooring and it'll add value to my home and it'll last forever and so-on. But then it seems like it can also scratch/dent pretty easily, it'll last forever but you will need to refinish it every so often. It'll add value to my home, but I don't plan to sell for 5-7 years.

I know that my wife and I would love the look of real wood floors in the home. She is totally against carpet, and I do not like the idea of tile throughout. Generally the houses in my area either have the same flooring as me (original to these 20 year old homes) or have swapped out for hardwood.  


I thought maybe going with a high-quality strand-woven bamboo would work, since it is supposed to be extremely hard, but I don't know anyone personally who could vouch for it and while the manufacturers says it can be refinished, none of the professionals in my area had every refinished a bamboo floor.  


I'm in a position where I can afford wood floors, but I want to buy the best option and not necessarily the most popular option. I would hate to regret my huge purchase in a few years, whether that means because I didn't get a good product or because I over paid for something that is worse than another option.

Everything from the walls to the appliances (dishwasher, dryer etc),  windows & screens just reek. I don’t want this smell of somebody else’s negligence to cling to my possessions (not sure if that’s how it works, but whatever). Already got a new home water filtration system and pipe cleaning, cause they were old and rusty, causing the well water to smell as well (see what I did there). So enough money spent already just trying to get a normal smelling house, but it seems like a lot more has to be spent, considering not much has changed throughout the house. We have clean water now, which is cool, but I’m not sure if the washer and dryer are just completely ruined at this point, or what. I mean the washer has the clothes smelling good (now), but the inside of it, empty, smells dirty. And the dryer makes the clothes smell, just weird.... Looking like I’m gonna have to either hire painters (again) to do more than just two rooms, or possibly do it myself, cause it’s not really in the budget.

I know the smell is embedded into the walls and carpet, so all I can do is either paint (or hire someone) and replace even more carpets (essentially every one in the house), so I guess what I’m mainly asking here is

1. Will I need a new dryer?

2. Is it the window screens, or the windows as a whole? Cause when I open them (even the rooms that had carpets replaced and were painted) smell like dog

3. Are there any tested and proven methods other than maintenance to get rid of this smell? (I’ve researched the Ozone treatment)

So I’m going with some 6x24 plank style porcelain tiles that need to be 33% offset.

But what confuses me is that the “1/3 running bond” is a 50% offset because every other row lines up.

BUT the centers of the tiles of each row do not meet up to the ends of the other rows’ tiles... which is the purpose of the 33% offset?

So... back to the point...

He was a wonderful person. He was a handy man, electrician, and locksmith and in the middle of so many projects. We’re trying to finish what we can for her to try and help her through this. 

They live in a house from the early 1900s but they’ve updated most rooms as far as flooring and paint goes, and the kitchen. 

The problems are:

1) I can see clearly into the partially finished basement from 1 floor vent, it’s not attached to the ventilation and I’m not sure why. 

2) there is absolutely no soundproofing whatsoever between the basement and the first floor. When a TV is on downstairs you can hear it plain as day through the registers in the floor. 

3) the storm door is insanely heavy. My hardy 4 year old can’t open it by himself. 

4) He closed off a window to make a 2nd bathroom but from the outside it looks like a boarded up window. Do I just need that tyvek stuff and find some siding that matches?

5) when the bathroom tub has water splashed out it drips right into the basement. - caulking around all the seems of the tub/floor and toilet/floor?

6) when the little jack russel dog runs across the floor of the kitchen you can feel the floor bouncing. I saw floor jacks are $50 at Lowe’s and I’m sure I can look up videos as to how to do it - do I just find the weakest joist and put it there?

7) their gas oven doesn’t have a range to vent anywhere. Is that ok? 

8) the flooring in their kitchen is like a laminate plank but completely smooth. If anything, even a little TV remote falls it’s so loud that it sounds like a gunshot. I’m wondering if there’s no padding between the plank and the subfloor? Maybe this is me being picky. It just seems excessive lol",39,281,HomeImprovement,1804

Our deck needs to be replaced.  It's about 20 years old, is made of wood, and wasn't well maintained before we moved in.  The deck is huge, approximately 40' x 60' and surrounds an above-ground pool.  The deck is about 4' off the ground.

Last year, I had a couple of quotes to get the deck replaced with composite, and the cheapest I got was well over $50k.  That is...not in my budget.  I did some research with local companies as well online, and I can afford the material, so my new plan is to do the work myself.

Based on the quotes I got, I know that the substructure is fine and in good shape, and my joists are 16"" on center, which means it can support composite.

My issue is that I'm unsure of how to actually design the deck properly so it looks good and is safe.  The current deck has the railing attached incorrectly (it's lag bolted along the outside of the deck), so it's not just a matter of taking out the old and installing the new.  Plus, we plan on replacing our pool at the same time, and I have a couple of ideas on how I want it to look and also make it a little smaller (i.e. cheaper). 

I feel like the best option would be to pay a company to look at my project, work with me to determine what I need, and then provide detailed plans.  My problem is that none of the deck companies I've contacted do that - they want to do the design & build.

honestly, I can't wait to get rid of the oil burner...not a fan of it at all.  natural gas isn't available where we live so our only options would be propane, electric baseboard, or electric heat pump.  i've been reading about heat pumps for both our HVAC needs.  considering the house has ductwork installed already, the cost of conversion would be lessened by a bit, though i'm sure an expert would find areas of improvement with the current ductwork (though it's only about 10 years old.)

of course, I would need to install a hot water heater though with the boiler removed from the current boiler room, this would be the perfect place for it.  also, heating the basement would require either a separate unit (such as a mini-split) or the extension of ductwork.  getting a duct into the basement would likely obliterate one of the closets so i'm leaning more towards a mini-split down there.

I guess my big question with this is: is this an idea even worth exploring?  I know heat pumps don't do well in extreme cold but it doesn't get that terrible in the winter here and there are also new units that do well into the negatives so that shouldn't be an issue.  locally, power with NYSEG is relatively cheap (especially compared to other places in NY...)  i'd love to hear some of your experiences, especially those of you in the hudson valley.

nclgc9,"Small repair job, not up to code - should I just let it go, or expect something from the contractor?","A small flight of concrete steps leading from our back yard to our basement was very cracked and in need of repair. A contractor suggested laying bricks on top of each step after patching the concrete. We asked 'Wouldn't that mean the top step is much shallower than the others: isn't that a code violation?' and he replied (his English is not great) ""Your steps all be have same height."" So we went ahead: I assumed he'd do something along the lines of, um, shaving the bricks to make the risers all the same height (I have zero experience with this kind of thing).

&#x200B;

Turned out, after the job, the top step was indeed much shallower. I pointed this out, and he came back and did something that evened it out a bit. But the top two steps' riser height is now 6.5"", and the rest are 7.5"". That's still out of CA code. 

&#x200B;

Now the contractor is insisting he told us it would just be an overlay (with the implication, I suppose, that we should have known what the result would be, and we therefore asked him to do work that wasn't up to code), and he is also claiming that the steps were uneven before (I don't think they were, but maybe). 

&#x200B;

I wish I had gotten a more detailed contract, proper assurance that the work would be up to code, and details of how he planned to ensure that, instead of just trusting him.

nchoom,Since we're sharing pantries...,"Our old house has been remodeled a few times by previous owners, some of it great, some of it not so great. There is a short hall to the back door that had a pantry of sorts with shelving, some coat pegs, and 6-panel bypass doors. It gave the illusion of separate compartments but in reality it was one big shared space. Storing mops, brooms, pet food, people food, pots and pans, etc. all in the same space was not ideal.

Making the most of the pandemic, I designed and built a remodel of this space and I'm really happy with the result. It is now a pantry on one side with a broom closet and pet food drawer in the middle, and a coat/shoe nook on the right. I'm an amateur but the build is solid and works well. My wife is thrilled. The new pantry uses a barn door, allowing full use of the space for storing things. The barn door only intrudes into the hallway a couple inches, and by building a nook we no longer hang coats on the opposite wall. The net effect is a more open walkway.

[This is what it looked like](https://i.imgur.com/aUCykT9.jpg) to begin with. The doors and some shelves were already gone by the time I remembered to take a photo. The bypass doors took up 5"" of the depth, so the shelves were all 12"" deep. Everything but one vertical was particle board. (Side note - some of that old particle board was astonishingly heavy. They used to make it out of who knows what but it held up very well, although it was not pretty.) [Here is another ""before"" view](https://i.imgur.com/du0pFHk.jpg).

After gutting the space and cleaning up the walls, I built [a couple new verticals and installed new 17"" deep shelving and some dividers](https://i.imgur.com/ccioJcM.jpg) per specs from the client (my lovely wife). I used 3/4"" plywood that came pre-finished (from HD) on one side. It didn't cost much more than the unfinished sheet and saved me a ton of finishing time. I used teak oil on the unfinished side where necessary. Next I built in a sliding shelf, put trim on all exposed plywood edges, and installed a cabinet face to the right [as seen here](https://i.imgur.com/MRAncK0.jpg). Teak oil was also used on the wood shelf-edge trim.

With [the barn door installed](https://i.imgur.com/5DxFncj.jpg) I was able to confirm clearance with the back door. Both can open fully and not conflict at any point. Because of the existing height, I had to mount the barn door through the case molding. I considered other options but decided this was the best approach and it worked out perfectly. The door is a hollow-core Jeld-Wen unit. I was a little concerned that it would not work with the barn door hardware, but it actually works well. The lighter weight is a plus.

Finally I finished [the broom cabinet and nook](https://i.imgur.com/tkwQpjK.jpg) and painted everything. Missing in these photos is vertical trim between the barn door and cabinet, which just finishes it a bit more. The [broom cabinet](https://i.imgur.com/GTuSRAE.jpg) also has a slot for grocery bag storage and a lower shelf for canned pet food. I later lined the drawer by constructing and inserting a box made of corrugated plastic so it can store dry pet food with no contact with the wood. I included a divider so it can have both dog and cat food.

I reused the one piece of solid wood from the original closet to make [a shelf](https://i.imgur.com/7bJvK0e.jpg) above the nook. I went with a curved design because it echoes design cues seen in the rest of the house.

This project was completed in late March. [Finished and loaded](https://i.imgur.com/GeSr8vB.jpg) it has proven to be very functional and a much better use of the space. I also built a slide-out appliance drawer on the bottom that wasn't shown in the other photos. All of the drawers have soft-close mechanisms to pull them completely closed, ensuring they won't collide with the barn door. I also installed a soft-close mechanism on the barn door which keeps it at one side or the other and has a pleasant action.

Alas, I do not know how much this cost in total. Partly because I didn't keep track very well and partly because I don't want to know. Probably more than I think it did!

Through this project I learned that I should have bought a pocket hole jig kit a long time ago. That thing is incredibly handy for joining boards in all kinds of situations, not just cabinets.

Update: Thanks for all the advice! I opened her up as I too, am uncomfortable with the unknown. I half expected some flight of the Valkyries shit where swarms of termites popped out and ate me alive. Lucky for me it didn't appear to be active in this part and looks to be localized to the closet,didn't even make it into the attic.

Bad news, they did some damage. Termites gotta eat I guess..so now I need to figure out how to best deal with it. All advice welcome.

nchbc3,Has anyone used bleach in their well?,"hi thanks ! We will have to do this because we have elevated Bacteria .


I am conflicted there basically too much info and it doesn't all match up 

Some info if relevant 
(6inches diameter 500 ft deep )
Our water can be fairly limited 
Wooded area 
septic system 

----We are thinking 3 gallons of bleach 
Or is 1/2 gallon is really universally enough ?

-----Do we really have to run a hose off property to flush the system?
Will that kill anything we have a pond lawn and woods that we don't f with , if yes then where does it go ?
 Is this to save the septic ? 

---Can we use less bleach to mitigate this ? 
We had one slightly elevated bacteria but had been drinking it for a year 

Finally  
------How soon can we take showers or run the dishwasher ? 
Is it 24 hours for everything ? including 
The critical laundry and showers

I think half of us would prefer a risk a bleach shower to no shower . Would that affect the septic ?

I took a screw driver to knock anything out of the track, but, when I tried replacing it, the new seal wouldn't go in.  The ""T"" seemed too big to fit the fitting. So I cut it down on one side of the ""T"" for both sides or ""T""s of the seal.

The two GCs that came out said I just need to replace the broken part but never actually took it off. They sent me an estimate to which I agreed to and then I don't hear from them again.

nccned,Mini split estimate help!,"We're in NJ and have gotten several quotes for mini split AC systems, but having a really hard time comparing them. We have a 1920's home that really wouldn't support conventional AC, and as it turns out our room layout seems to be a challenge for mini-splits as well. The quotes we've gotten vary wildly in price, but also in scope. For example, one bedroom is on the opposite site of the house as just about every other space. One contractor wants to go through the basement and up, one wants to go up to the attic and down, and other just gave up and said ""let's not include that room."" We also have a finished, but unheated/cooled attic space that half the estimates just didn't include.

Long story short, the configuration that seems the most complete and appealing is a Mitsubishi system with the following:

- 2 outdoor units

- 5 indoor units (2 wall units, 1 floor unit, 2 ducted units placed the attic that would service 2 rooms each from above). We know we'd be giving up a bit of individual room control, but it would give us the most coverage given our constraints.


The estimate for this system is ~$26k and doesn't include the cost of an electrician which may be another $1-2k. It's the most expensive estimate we got but also covers the most areas of the house. Anyway, we weren't looking to pick it apart for small savings, but just wanted to get a sanity check for if it sounds right, given how hard it is to compare to the others. Would appreciate anyone who has more experience!


EDIT: The other quotes were:

- $21.5k for a Mitsubishi, 2 outdoor units, 4 indoor wall units. Included electrical

- $16k for a Fujitsu, 1 outdoor unit, 5 indoor units (4 wall, 1 floor). Didn't include electrical

- $11.2k for a Fujitsu, 2 outdoor units, 2 indoor units. (This config pretty much gave up and ignored almost every space, including a bedroom, kitchen and living room area.) Didn't include electrical


The $26k quote is by far the most expensive, but is the only one that included a unit in our kitchen, and also the only one to offer the ducted units in the attic. The attic units are appealing because they are the least invasive for our layout, and also made it the only estimate that offered to heat/cool our finished attic space, as well as a bathroom that we weren't even thinking about hitting.",9,2,HomeImprovement,2319

- [attic fan/vent](https://imgur.com/o4BXjmO) is sole exhaust for double bathroom fans
- has worked once in 8 months as far as we can tell
- does not appear to be connected to switch in bath
- does not work reliably (switch in the landing area of 2nd floor)
- sounds like it has bad bearings

Questions:

- How should I proceed? Surely this is a terrible exhaust solution.
    - should the tubes be terminated directly to exhaust?
        - attic was absolutely hot as hell, sweating in 30 seconds when it was approx 70f outside, so perhaps this fan should just.. run always?
    - just need to replace the fan?
- Is there any reasonable purpose for this to be switched from the landing?
- Is the unreliable nature typical of a presumably 50 year old fan? electrical concerns?
    - I didn't find any immediately obvious damage to wiring, but it is/has been a mouse haven

ncc09h,Crashing water noises from in-wall pipes,"I live in the bottom unit of a 4-floor condo building. Based on my analysis of the plumbing, it seems there is a vertical drain pipe which services floors 2-4, which meets a 90 degree bend in our ceiling. It then runs horizontally to meet up with the city sewer line.

It seems that when the top floors flush a toilet or have a similar sudden release of water, it falls 2 to 3 stories and then crashes into pipe bend (right above my head). The pipes are PVC and our walls don't provide a ton of noise deadening, so the sound can be quite loud. Occasionally it even seems like the pipes are knocking against the studs (or something like that) from the force of the crashing water.

I suspect that any sort of sound dampening would involve opening up the walls to install some sort of mass loaded wrap. But on a basic level, is this sort of design and sound normal? Or are the pipes going to wear themselves down from taking this force over long periods of time?",5,2,HomeImprovement,960

So I decided that we needed a pantry on a friday 2 weeks ago, and set out to build one. This is my first time attempting something like this, but I think it came out ok. I measured out 66""x54"", picked up some studs, drywall, and a door, [and got to work](https://i.imgur.com/b8R9W3y.png). 

[It was a bit tricky](https://i.imgur.com/UGlAuQs.png) getting the framing done. I didn't want to damage anything that I couldn't undo. Screws up and down, then nail gun for the studs. 

[Drywall and mud](https://i.imgur.com/pyxpUdD.jpg) went pretty quick. I did my best to make it as even as possible with the previous wall and I got damned close. I measured everything and while it's not perfect, it's about as good as I could have expected.

[Paint went quick](https://i.imgur.com/s5mUew1.png) and I was on to the door trim and molding, but my wife pushed me to finish the inside first so she could use it.

[Ripped some plywood shelving](https://i.imgur.com/dcWeXAw.jpg) I had laying around from other projects and my wife started crying. I asked what was wrong and she said it was going so well but now it sucks.

So off to home depot again. I couldn't find 1-by's that were anything close to strait, it was all terrible, so pvc 1-by. Then to the $57 a sheet plywood. I have to admit, [it was looking better](https://i.imgur.com/TBaZCCa.jpg).

Then I thought, [wrap it around](https://i.imgur.com/3a5GZ3Q.jpg) to get as much shelf space as possible. I am definitely glad I went with 24"" shelves instead of 12"". Plus, 1x12""x8' was $45, so for just $12 more, i got 4x as much.

[First coat of paint](https://i.imgur.com/tqy7SrB.jpg) then leftover mud to fill the gaps/holes. My house isn't truly square, and my walls aren't truly flat, and my cuts aren't perfectly strait.

I'm glad I went with 3/4 board instead of half inch, not just for hte better finish, but added rigidity. All the shelves are also screwed down in the corners as well so I think that helps.

New homeowner here.  Our rooftop deck is about two years old.  They used pressure treated pine.  When the boards get a lot of water (early/mid spring) the boards expand a lot and pop the screws.

Due to the high traffic here and the fact that the doggos like to lie and wrestle there, it'll never grow grass in that spot. So I'm putting in some pavers, which I kind of wanted to do anyway.

Never done pavers like this before, but I know the general process. My shed is at a high point in the corner of the back yard.

&#x200B;

So I'm building a shed, 12'x10' Arrow  brand sheet metal, see picture for site.  I would like to be able to  park a riding mower in this thing. I'm a newbie and all these plans are  subject to change, so bear with me.  The original plan was to make a  flat base out of gravel and 1' concrete pavers (which I have free access  to loads of.)  I jumped the gun and dug dirt and got gravel dumped only  to find out that the corner where the gravel is sitting is about 14""  lower than the opposite corner (I know, I'm an idiot).  The solid gravel  foundation with pavers is out the window because I don't want to mess  with a retaining structure.

The  New foundation plan is to dig into the ground 6""-8"", level and pack  gravel, and stack pavers to make support piles in a 3x4 grid.  Corner  piles being at the corners of the 12'x10' floor.  The tallest pile will  be around 18-20"" tall.  Will the stacked pavers be strong enough to  support my shed?  Should I think about gluing the pavers together, or  will they be stable enough being held by the weight of the shed?

For  my floor the plan is to build a box out of 2x6 PT lumber with a center  2x6 running the 12' length.  Then using joist hangers to put 2x6s at 12""  intervals in each section as joists.  The other idea is to lay 4x4  beams on the paver piles and build the box on top of that without the  center 2x6.  Which is better?  Also with the first option should my  joists in each section be staggered from each other?  It seems like if  they're not the screws from the hangers will hit each other.  See  picture of flooring schematics.  I kind of want to avoid the 4x4 beam  option to reduce the height the shed sits off the ground.  I will then  use 3/4"" PT OSB as the top.

The  original plan was to have the door facing on the side where most of the  gravel is.  I'm thinking to rotate the shed 90 deg. counter clockwise to  make the door side a little lower to grade.  Building a ramp will come  later.  Is there any ideas on what I can do to make access better into  this thing?  The tree cuts off using the high face as door access.

nc6c96,Electric Fireplace Reno,"Hi Folks,

My wife and I are wanting to renovate our current electric fireplace in our living room. We have bought a new insert and are looking to change out the tile to a white brick looking tile and add in a mantle. We are going to tile only up to the mantle and then painT the drywall behind the tv. Note the tiles are loose on the wall at the moment and i think it’s a combination of putting them direct on plywood (read drywall is better for a wall) and the tile guy I had in also said he thinks they didn’t use enough mortar when he pulled one off.

I’ve called around and got a couple quotes and everyone is telling me they are tied up until the end of the year. We’d like to get it done sooner so are thinking of tackling it ourselves along with my brother in law. I’m not the most handy but can learn and I’ve done some stuff around the house - changing light fixtures, swapping hot water tank, running some ABS pipe, painting and spray foaming my rim joists. He on the other hand is very crafty with metal as he is a millwright but doesn’t work much with wood and drywall. 

I’ve got a few questions that will help decide if we attempt it ourselves.

1. The fireplace is currently built over the sub floor with hardwood around it. The new insert we bought is about 5 inches deeper so the frame has to be built out. Could we built it out over the hardwood or would we want to cut up the hardwood and build over the sub floor? My thoughts are if we change the flooring at some point there may be a strange gap there if we didn’t take it to the sub floor.

2. We both have never done drywall before - do you have any suggestions to great how to videos?

3. The current FP is hard wired in and the new one will be as well. If there is not enough slack in the wires I assume we will need to get an electrician in to extend them?

4. She wants to add shelves to the side of the FP above where the tv box / Xbox sits and move stuff up there.

nc5ay0,Improving garden security,"Hi folks,

My back garden is accessible by the public as I live on a street with businesses on both sides of me. I’m always paranoid that someone will climb over the 2ft garden fence and enter my house. It’s not very difficult to climb and there has been increased reports of burglars entering people’s homes in my area so this doesn’t help with the anxiety. 

I’ve researched a bit and saw that barbed wire isn’t allowed because if the thief were to get hurt they could sue us. What can I use instead of this? I’ve read that some people use certain plants but I have never planted anything in my life and so have no clue how I would place the plant. 

Other than the plants does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do?

nc54m5,BubbleDeck (Application Of Plastic Balls In Concrete Construction) for the little guy,"TL;DR; where would I (the little guy) get plastic balls to put into my concrete slab.

I was watching a show (Engineering Catastrophes) where the building floors were poured with these plastic balls in the concrete slabs. Ironically the building floors failed, but that's besides the point. It seems that this is a ""verified"" technology that can save up to 30% on concrete and I'm just looking to do a 10x20 slab for my greenhouse. Saving 30% sounds like a really good deal so I figured I would look into it.

Alas searching for these products brings me to sites basically discussing the technology but no where are these balls to be found for purchase. It seems that this type of thing is reserved for the big guys who will be building huge structures.

Has anyone ever done something like this and if so where could someone like me find such lovely balls.

For reference here are a few sites discussing the tech:

[Application Of Plastic Balls In Concrete Construction](https://isaacuribeconcrete.com/application-of-plastic-balls-in-concrete-construction/)

[BubbleDeck North America](https://www.bbdna.com/) - this seems to be one of the sites that would sell them

So I built a hall on the 2nd floor of our building using zinc/metal sheets and tiles on top of it. It's been 4 years now and since the structure has been in place, I face water leaking problem in 2-3 places. I tried fixing it by contracting it to 2-3 other roofing companies and it only got worse.

So the sloping is towards my house and not away from it. The hall was built on a concrete structure but the very first contractor did not get the sloping done away from the house but towards the house so the water finds a way to drip from the corners. I was thinking to install another roofing sheet on the top of the existing one and give drain pipes in the slopes do you think this will fix my problem? I'm clueless and I cannot afford to contract it to another company which will further ruin it.

For now, I have used tarp to cover it up but the problem still exists.

I thought about just switching the motor but if a lamp does not work, a new motor would also not work since there is no electricity being fed into the top.

I checked GFCI and the breaker to see if anything was tripped, nothing.I tried changing the light switch connected to the vent fan as some sources online said that it could be the culprit, still nothing.

My question is what could it be or what should I try next?

One thing I want to note is when I measured the light switch from hot to neutral, it did say 86V instead of 120V but not sure if it was because I just had it badly positioned. The next time I tried, it sparked so I've been too scared to try a second reading.

He got to work while we were not home and when we came back I saw him scooping asphalt out of the bed of his truck with a shovel and tamping it down. I’m not familiar with different methods, so I assumed up to that point it was OK as he confirmed again it would look smooth and nice like the photos. 

At this point it is still uneven and looks terrible, even having tire tracks from him backing over it, and he started sealing it with something that comes in 1 gallon paint cans.

Can someone tell me each step that was done wrong, and whether it can be fixed to be a nice smooth driveway at this point, or if that would require tearing it out? We haven’t paid him anything yet, so I am hoping we can just pay him for the materials so far and have someone who knows what they are doing fix and finish it.

We found out this is an ERV unit. If you don't know what that is, you're not alone. The HVAC guy said he's seen 3 of them in 30 years. Basically it's a massive HEPA filter for your home. Brings in fresh air from outside, gets cleaned and pumped into your house. Super awesome for those with allergies or pets, both of which we have.  

The model we have is rare, it'd be weeks to get the parts. So they're replacing the whole thing and we won't need those switches anymore, it'll be programmed into the unit itself to turn on every 30 minutes. It reduces the load on your AC unit and uses way less electricity. $2200 for the whole shebang and it'll service a 4000 square feet home.

nbv3l9,Questions about fencing contractor,"I've seen posts regarding communication and timing with general contractors with multiple subs working on the project. I was wondering about my experience with a fencing contractor/ company owner, with a crew of 3 guys. He was recommended by a carpenter recommended by a friend/ landscaper. I'd gotten another proposal for the work and decided to go with this guy.

I'd paid for materials up front and he'd cashed my check. He told me he and his crew would be at my place at 8am in two days, on a specific day, and would finish the job that day.

So that day, I arranged my schedule to be home and ready for them at 8am.

Nobody showed up all day and I didn't hear anything from anyone. I texted and called the owner a few times throughout the day. At around 8pm that evening he annoyedly texted me back that he was in another city getting a medical procedure (heart test-- non emergency/ routine-- something he'd scheduled in advance), and that somebody from the crew was supposed to tell me they wouldn't be at my place that day.

He didn't mention anything to me about his planned heart test in another city when he spoke with me 2 days before the day he said he'd be at my place at 8am.

During that day when I didn't hear anything, I checked out reviews of him online and found several saying that this guy was friendly until he cashed your deposit check, then dodged/ rejected your calls and was difficult to schedule with. Some people said they were taking legal measures to get their deposit back because it had been weeks. There were several reviews like this, including warnings to steer clear and that this guy is sleazy. This made me super anxious.

They did end up coming a couple days later and finishing the project.

Since then, every year the fence posts get loose. This was after his assurance that the fence would last at least 10 years without any problems, complete with talking down my neighbor's fence.

He sent out a couple guys last year to tamp down the ground and level the posts. He told me they would call me before they came over. I didn't hear anything for weeks. I tried to call him a couple times and he either dodged my calls or said he was ""with a customer"" and hung up.

So I tried calling him from a different number and he immediately answered in a warm/ friendly tone, but when he realized it was me, he literally got angry and yelled at me that i was ""on the list to be fixed!"" and hung up.

At some point they came over to level the posts, without calling first. I just happened to be home and available, purely by chance.

This year I called him again because the posts are loose again. He told me he can't talk to me anymore and hung up.

nbujka,Old (new) house with plumbing issues," 

We recently purchased a house in South Florida and during inspection we encountered several plumbing issues. We tried negotiating it down to have some money to repair the issues, but in this hot market it was basically impossible. We have a small nest egg saved up for home improvements but I was hoping to ask here for some suggestions on how to best move forward and be ready for plumbers suggestions. 

The house has some PVC but most of it is cast iron that's at its end of life. Luckily there's a 3 foot crawl space under the house so we have access to half the house, but the other side is not accessible from that crawl space access. My major concern at the moment is the 2nd cleanout on the other side of the house has PVC running for as far as we can see, but when we ran a scope we encountered roots about 20 feet in. Unfortunately it looks like that pipe runs under our outside patio landing which is about 3 feet of concrete and has tile on it. We are trying to avoid ripping all the cement and tile up and have considered trenchless plumbing (the lining thing). My primary question is if its possible to treat the roots and keep the existing PVC instead of going into any heavy repair or the trenchless plumbing? Would love to hear your guys suggestions on the plumbing on the house as a whole. I've attached the videos and pics we have. Any help would be amazing for this first time homeowner!

Some background first: I rent a single story house that has either a large attic with 2 entries (one from the garage, one from the hallway), or two separate attics. This is in Florida. I’ve never been up to the attic(s) since I don’t have the need for that storage and it seems like more of a hassle to stow stuff in there than anything else. 

So after being here for about a year, we’ve had two instances of maggots. The first one was when we had just moved in and we didn’t keep the trash well isolated and it got nasty. We made sure to get rid of every maggot we could find and everything was fine for almost a year. 

Fast forward to last week and we found maggots again, paired with their grownup jerk buddies, flies. They’re kind of concentrated to the kitchen area, but nowhere near the trash or any area where you’d think enough crap could gather to attract flies. 

What’s more, after a very thorough cleaning, the maggots are out of sight but the flies remain. I wake up to find upwards of 20 flies around that one spot in the kitchen every day, and they just keep coming as I kill them off. 

My only conclusion, which I’d rather have an educated guess from this sub before I go up there, is that something dead is above that specific spot in the attic and they’re finding their way down after they go to town on whatever dead thing is there. 

Barring a dead thing in the attic, what do y’all think could be causing these flies?

First and most importantly, there is about a half-inch to quarter-inch gap between the trim and the wall on one side of the door, as well as along the top of the door. Secondly, the newly bought trim has light to moderate damage everywhere, 90% of it seems to be scuff marks that could be painted over, but a few spots have gouges and knicks taken out of it from what looks like hammer blows. I was told on the phone upon first calling that the wear to the trim is a normal part of the installation process and I just am supposed to paint the trim, but that smells of bull to me, I paid for and expected a finished product. Thirdly, there is slight damage and cracks in the drywall around the installation area that were not repaired. Finally, the trim along the top of the door is bowed, it's not very noticeable, but I confirmed that it's bowed downwards with a level. The bowed trim normally wouldn't have been that much of a problem, but it's just another straw on top of everything that's bothering me.

 I'll include pictures below of everything, please tell me what you guys think. Would you demand all new trim be installed? What needs to be done about the gaps between the door and the wall? Should they have repaired the drywall damage?

I purchased a house a few months ago (Late 1970's era), and during the inspection process, moisture and standing water was noted under the crawlspace.  One of our demands was 'fix - it'.  Flipper installed a sump, new vapor barrier (10m I think), semi-sealed the vents and a dehumidifier.  Basically a mini-encapsulation. Re-inspection a week later showed moisture was at an acceptable level for CL100, etc.  Fast forward a few months down the road.  While the area under the house isn't 'wet', it's not 'dry' either.  Vapor barrier is dry, and the moisture all appears to be under the barrier and it's 'mud', (think wet sandy clay-ish).  I cant find any standing water, but anytime it rains, the sump runs like crazy, for a day, then drops to once or twice a day.   I've had a few crawlspace companies come out (Called 8, 5 responded, 4 quoted - from 3900 - 15k.  The 15k drops to about 7k once I drop the parts not quoted by the others.  All basically want to encapsulate.  Some will use the existing pump/dehumidifier, some want to gut and start over. I however get a feel that while yes, this will help, it's treating the symptoms and not the cause.   My gut says to start with gutters, and try to create a slope away from the walls, but I'm not a drainage expert...  I'd love some advice!

Few facts:

House seems to sit a little lower than the neighbors, but there appears to be a natural (or man made) small swale between the houses running to the road.  

No Gutters. 

90% of the back of the house has a large concrete patio, appears to be sloped correctly away from house though.

Definite low spots within a few feet of the wall at the front of the house.  

(According to neighbor) Flipper ran a couple of carpet fans under the house for a day or two before the CL100. 

There are a few low spots in the back yard that hold water.  I dug a test hole around New Years and hit water table at 8 inches.  I dont know what the current (Summer) water table is sitting at.  

No nearby ditch to trench to.  

Existing Sump pump is discharging \~30 feet from house using included hose.

nbqoy2,Garage Door Alignment,"Edit: Added a sketch

Hi!

I have a frustrating issue with my garage door. When it is closed, there is a 1” gap between the edge of the bottom my weather stripping and the side trim (see image link). When the garage door is opening, the weather stripping gets to within 1/4” of the trim at the top so if I extend the weather stripping to close the gap, the door will not open all of the way (i.e. it seems like my door is out of alignment). Here is what I have tried:

Re-plumbed the vertical and horizontal tracks using a laser level.

Removed the tension from the spring to the cross bar (to release tension on cables) and retensioned the cables to make sure the garage door is hanging level from the cables. 

I’ve looked online and the only other idea I had was to shift the bottom of the vertical rail to physically move the garage door in where I have the gap but that may create opening and closing issues or make a gap on the other side!

Not sure if it matters, but the concrete under the door is sloped.

Thanks!!

The inspector who conducted the inspection did not say anything about mold in the attic space at the time of the purchase. 

Now we come to the present time, I knew from talking with the sellers of the home that the crawl space had been cleaned and all the insulation replaced, but the attic was still the original insulation from from when the house was built in 1976/77. I decided that was something I wanted to have done and had a couple companies that specialize in this come out to give me a quote. Both companies commented on the white mold that was on the surface on wood structure in my attic. Suggesting that the roof is not venting properly. The bird blocks only have two holes per block, there is a ridge vent installed along the whole ridge of the house and there are vents in both gable trusses at either end of the house. 

After going up in the attic and looking at it myself, the extant of the mold isn't ""bad"" I'd say, at least not for the a house built in the late 70's. So it seems like the original roof that was venting much better than the new roof installed in a 2019. 

So is this something I should bring up to the roofing company that installed the roof back in June of 2019 and do I have and course of action with them?

Water lines can be two sharkbite Ts into the existing lines and then pex straight across the bottom of the wall then 90s up to where the faucet would connect?

nbl3k1,samsung active water jet washer issues,"I generally love samsung products and own probably too many of them. phones, tablets, vacuums, laptops, and the washer..............

however this washer, is so much trouble. bought it a little over a year ago and its never broke or anything so its not related to reliability, but my goodness, i just dont even know if it washes. all of the washing cycles it just gently swirls around back and forth, i suppose enough to consistently mix the garments around up down left right etc but definitely doesnt seem as effective as the ones with those center columns. maybe im just not understanding this new supposedly improved method.

however, that really isnt the issue. not sure if i have something setup wrong, but its the water temp.

in almost all cycles, the water comes out STEAMING hot unless i set the temp all the way down. even at level 2, it pours out hot water so my activewear thats only supposed to be washed in cold, is submerged in hot to the touch water (and level 2 is the default setting for their 'active wear' cycle). it eventually puts in some cold water to balance it, but the way it seems to work is it ONLY uses hot water, THEN adds only cold, never a mix to make them warm in the first place which i definitely believe will damage some clothes.

is this a common issue with washers or this samsung, or do i have something setup wrong?",0,1,HomeImprovement,1356

However, I am planning a big renovation that will change the layout of my upstairs, including removing hardwood for a bathroom and adding some for the expansion of the bedroom. I don't want to refinish until that is done. I'm not sure when that will be done- everyone is super backed up and honestly, I kind of want to wait because I have two very very old cats who basically live in those rooms and I hate to disturb them that much at their age. The fact that waiting might mean getting past the crazy peak we are having in construction costs is another incentive. 

I'm tired of finding pieces of finish stuck to my feet and I'm worried having bare wood exposed may cause damage to it. Is there anything I can do for my floors right now to protect the bare areas and maybe even stop the peeling? Should I just sand the bad spots and wipe some poly on them?

nbk9hs,Gap between my building and attached building causing air leak,"Over the winter I bought an IR camera and discovered that my back wall in my office had a cold spot. Now that it has gotten warmer I opened a small hole in the drywall to take a photo to see what was going on and discovered a fairly sizable gap between my building and the attached condo/apartment building next door. 

I was already planning on taking down the drywall to add insulation to prevent noise transfer with the building next door so I was considering fixing this from the inside rather than risking a 50ft fall on a ladder to try to solve it from the outside or hiring someone. 

I am thinking about putting closed cell spray foam between my building's corner support and then getting a flashing peel and stick tape to fully ensure it is sealed even if the buildings shift. I would also use the same peel and stick to attach my floor support beam to the next building which I suspect will also help dampen noise transfer up. Then insulating the walls as I previously intended with mineral wool insulation as I originally intended. 

Is this a crazy idea? What kind of peel and stick should I get to attach metal to concrete?

- Have the small slivers of tile and hate it forever  

- Cut the two tiles affected a bit long and leave those grout lines out all together  

- Find some other 1"" wide tile to bridge the gap, but this would also leave me with a U shaped tile on top of the niche.    

- Get some small subway shaped tile and make a frame around the niche before using pencil trim, but this sounds kinda busy..

Anyway, I disconnected it from the tank and bent it to the side to move it out of the way when it snapped almost in two. It's currently just sitting there like Nearly Headless Nick's head.

We're in Canada. Neither of our neighbours are willing to split the cost and it doesn't sound like that is going to change anytime soon. We want the fence for privacy and aesthetics.

There is a portion along the alley where there is no existing fence that we will go ahead with regardless. Along the sides with the neighbours there are fences, however they are shorter than we would like, a mismatch, and in poor shape in some places leaning over to our side.

nbexe8,Brick wall foundation issue,"I have a 1993 house, slab on grade, with a brick veneer wall approx 20 ft long, single story. The slab has a perimeter foundation wall of 2 courses then a poured footing. This wall has moved laterally 3/16"" causing the cmu mortar joints at the end walls to open up. I'm guessing it is just poorly done backfill in this area and undersized gutters that overflowed in heavy rain (resolved). Inside at the wall edge there is the same gap between the wall and the slab. Slab and wall have not sunk at all as far as I can see. 

I have access to the brick ledge top course of block. My thought is to mechanically fasten through the top course to the slab with anchor bolts. Slab is at least 6"" thick. Not too worried about pulling it back but just providing resistance to future movement. 

Good idea? I imagine it won't really hurt anything. If it does need bigger repair later it is pretty easy to grind the bolts off.

Pics for context https://imgur.com/a/DZv8ILj/

I am planning on doing a full sand, Fill and seal of a portion of the floors (500 sq ft) of an older house. Half of the house has elm floors which are reasonably beat up and definitely need new polyurethane coating. The other half is oak, and was installed a couple of decades later, and is in much better shape.  Minus a couple of nasty gouges that were likely from a bed post, but will be covered up again with an even larger bed so I’m not gonna worry about those. 

The two woods do butt up against each other in a very visible place. I do not want to go through the time and expense of refinishing the oak, since it is really pretty good as is. However, I’m afraid that next to the soon-to-be newly refinished elm, it’s going to look pretty scuffed up.

I’m wondering if there is some kind of “in-between” where I can sort of buff/wax or something.  Obviously I don’t want these things to shine like a gym floor, we are going for a satin finish when we redo the elm portion, but is there any thing I can do to the oak to just give it a face lift without the sanding/sealing?

Edit 2: I received the invoice today and it says that it's  due today.  All late payments are assessed at 2% monthly interest (24%  APR) which makes it seem extra shady to me.

Edit 3: The increase in price is not because of material costs, I purchased those and provided them for the contractor.  It was all just labor. (And some minor material purchases that I didn't authorize).

Edit 4: This was work on a fence and the rail was improperly done which will cause it to sag.  Since it  would require the entire fence to be reconstructed to fix, I was willing to sweep it under the rug at the price I thought I was paying.

The inspector was good and walked me through the house and was very responsive to questions. When he was doing the exterior I had to tend to another matter and my wife was there. He assessed the roof but did so from street level. The report does not say he used binoculars and he didn’t go up on the roof. According to his comments and report, he thinks the roof shingles were replaced within 5 years and are a single layer. The house was built in 1940 and has had a few owners, with the most recent one renting it out. In the master bedroom (top floor) there was a water stain (about 6”x 4”) that he couldn’t pinpoint (moisture meter didn’t show it as wet and a look at the attic didn’t show anything for sure). The dried water mark MAY be under a vent of some sort on the roof.

nb5cd0,Vent and Return Location,"I have a 900 square foot finished basement with no vents and no returns - surprise, it's cold downstairs. I want to add two vents and a return (shown in the linked diagram below in yellow). The ductwork is run through the first floor open joists. I have suspended ceiling in the basement so access isn't a problem. The problem is I'm tired of being cold in the basement. While it never gets really cold in Maryland, it's been cold enough that I have to wear a light jacket when in the basement for any length of time.

Questions I have:

First (and possibly the most important) are the sizes of the supply lines to the vents adequate? Too big? Too small?

Are these good locations for the vents and return?

nb536v,Lost power to detached garage...stumped.,"Spent the afternoon putting up slatwall in my detached garage.  Finished up and found the garage had no power.

I have a 20amp load center in the garage and I saw that it was off.  I thought maybe I had bumped it during the install because it wasn't in that partial ""tripped"" position.

I worried that I had nicked a wire during the install despite using nail plates.  Took everything down but I don't see any issues with the wiring.

The breaker in the house was not tripped; in fact, the tankless water heater is on the same circuit and is running fine.

When I flip the load center breaker on, I see a bit of red in the little window - but not the whole window.  The breaker doesn't trip when I flip it from off to on.    https://imgur.com/JGNkOzg

What would you guys ask for? Installer said he can come back and fix resin patch (it’s always going to be resin...) and cut the sink back to my desired depth (there are faucet holes drilled so that would also put the faucet right on the edge of the sink

Lastly, the sink is 3/16” crooked, so the flush edge of the countertop on the back shows varying depths of the under mount lip. 

The crookedness can be corrected. The depth can be fixed. The faucet distance to sink would then be really close and the resin cannot be “fixed”.

nb4kh5,[Deck rebuild] - Replacing bearers with smaller ones without changing final height,"Hi everyone! I'm rebuilding a deck at my home and need some help with maintaining the original height of the deck. The main issue is replacing the bearers, which sit on brick pylons. 

The bearers are currently 100x100 mm, but due to product availability and convention in NSW, Australia, I'll likely be replacing them with 90x90 mm bearers instead. How can I prevent the whole deck being reduced in height by 10 mm? 

So far, I've reasoned that I can either:

1) Put 10 mm shims between the pylons and the bearers to bring them to original height; or
2) Use unusually large joists; or
3) Let it drop 10 mm and have it no longer be flush with the door frame to which it connects;

Option 1 seems the easiest, but I don't want my shim to shrink over time and cause the deck to sag.

I purchased the GE flexible metal dryer duct (https://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-Flexible-Metal-Dryer-Duct-PM08X10085DS/205472610?) and the length is 8 feet. In my laundry room the dryer when pushed back is about 1.5 feet from the dryer vent on the wall to the dryer vent on the gas dryer.

nb2riu,How can improve the seal on my windows?,"I recently bought a new construction condo. Some of my windows seal very poorly. I think maybe due to the house settling slightly or the windows being framed poorly. I can tell that some of the windows don't seal that well, because I can visibly see some gaps in the weatherstripping, and some of them let outdoor noise in more than others.

There seems to be two sets: One flat weatherstrip that seals against the frame of the window on the outside, and one bulbous strip that seals against the inside of the window frame.

For some reason, the flat strip has been cut in the corners of every window, leaving a 1 inch gap (there's a picture of this in the album linked). Is there any reason for this? 

The bulbous strip does not actually touch the inside of the frame on all of the windows. In some cases, there is a large gap.

I bought a house last year and one of the renovations I knew I'd want to complete is installing a privacy fence. My current fence, and all of my neighbor's fences, are the old dilapidated original chain-link from the 50's.

I've read that I should talk to my neighbors before tearing down their fence and replacing it, but how exactly do I go about it when none of them own their property? Also, if the renters do nothing to maintain their yard except get someone cheap to come mow it every few weeks, can I trust the other side of the fence to be taken decent care of? For instance, I've had to go remove vines and sprouting trees along the existing fence line both years since I've moved in. There's one tree that's decades old that's grown into the fence that will need to be removed.

I don't mind having to call and go into their property every couple years to stain the wood. However I'm concerned that with a larger, nicer fence it's more things that could go wrong if, for instance, a renter moves in that's a nuisance. For example, currently the house next to mine has not picked up leaves and brush for what looks like five years. To install the fence on that side would require their yard to finally get cleaned up (the current fence is holding back the mountain of leaf litter) but what about five years after that when all the debris could damage the wood?

If anyone has any experience with stuff like this, I'd appreciate the input. I would really like to put up a nice fence to bring the whole backyard together, and I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it or not.

Oh and I want to mention, nothing against my neighbors, they're all retirement age or hard working folks that aren't home much but like I said they don't have a reason to keep up with their yard and I don't blame them, I was the same way when I rented.

So needless to say I'm going to replace the weather strip. I'm in Ontario, currently under lockdown so I can't pop into the hardware store.

Hoping you can help, I'm looking for a black door jamb weather strip. I have a picture of my current door and a link to two I found online. Would this work? I'm seeing a lot of options for screw on strip but my door jamb has the slot for a non screw option.

Does anyone have any products or solvents to get this stuff off the wall without destroying the sheet rock? I'm ok with removing the paint from underneath as the whole wall needs to be reprimed and repainted so that's not a huge deal. Any help or advise is greatly appreciated. Thanks all!

&#x200B;

\-I'm single

\-No kids

\-No plans to change either of the above

\-No plans on moving.  House is meh and needs a bunch of work, but I'm in love with the property and would live in a tent if I had to.  Short of winning the lottery, I don't see myself being able to afford what I'd consider an upgrade for 10 years or more.  

\-Pandemic aside, I rarely have overnight guests.  When I do, it's typically one person/couple.

&#x200B;

This house was built in the 70s, so it is the exact opposite of an open floorplan.   Removing the wall between one bedroom and the main living room would open that side of the house nicely, effectively doubling the size.  I'm fairly certain the wall in question is structural, in which case it would require a beam to support that span, so I'd need to hire a structural engineer.  Only a single outlet on the wall, nothing else running through to relocate.

Aside from installing the beam and patching the wall, that's pretty much all it'd take I think.  Both areas are due for new flooring and paint as is.  This would result in two bedrooms (which would share a wall).  

&#x200B;

The full bathroom is quite small.  Single small vanity, toilet, tub, and enough room to stand basically. The half bath (in the master bedroom) is just big enough for a toilet and small wall-mounted sink (no room for vanity even).  They are directly next to each other, so I could just bust the wall down and combine the two.  Would require moving some plumbing, but it's all exposed and easily accessible underneath from the basement.  This would certainly be the more involved and more expensive project of the two.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As far as resale value goes, I'm sure a 3/1.5 would sell a lot easier than a 2/1, but considering I have no plans to move, I think I'm making it a bigger deal of it than I should.  Plus, making that space back into a 3rd bedroom would be fairly easy.  Not the case for the bathroom of course.",18,5,HomeImprovement,2148

Major Defects:

1.  Standing water throughout crawl space which should be evaluated by a licensed water proofing company

Safety Concerns:

1. Water Heater T&P Drain angles up, must be gravity fed

2. One cable added inside the electrical panel without an NM conector

3. There were open junction boxes in the attic exposing live wires

4. The kitchen GFCI protected receptacle left of the sink has reverse polarity preventing it from tripping when testing

Defects:

1. One shingle tab broken off and had an unconventional repair made

2. Bathroom exhaust fan missing the attic duct

3. 4 Inches of insulation in the attic, normally 10 inches or more

4. Floor joist cut out under master bathroom to allow room for the plumbing drain lines, wasn't boxed in to properly support subflooring

5. Some selections of insulation in the crawl space was installed backwards with the vapor barrier facing the wrong way which will trap moisture in the subflooring and should be removed

6. The return air duct was lying on the wet ground and could have moisture inside the duct which should be evaluated and raised above ground

Here is a crude picture of my situation:

https://imgur.com/39a7WjI


So my current clean-out for my drain line is about 150 feet and two 90 degree turns from a tree, and the roots of that tree are constantly growing into the drain line.  The previous owner was pouring root killer down the drain once a year and calling it a day.  I had the sewer line scoped as part of the inspection (best $350 I ever spent) and the guy that did it was not happy with what he found.  He couldn't scope all the way to the main sewer line because the roots eventually blocked his camera.  He suggested that I get it rodded, which I was able to have done by the previous owner before closing.

I asked the guy 1) what my options were, and 2) what he recommends.

He said right now I'd be looking at rodding once a year ($250ish a year), because of the distance and the fact that my clean-out is a smaller diameter than the drain line at the point of interest, so it isn't possible to cut the roots back completely.  If it were up to him, he would probably install a new cleanout closer to the tree with a bigger diameter, then he says I could probably get away with rodding once ever 4 years or so.

My options, as I see them, are:

#1:  New clean out at yellow area ($2,000ish) and rod once every 4 years ($250ish)

#2:  New drain line that avoids the tree completely ($????)

#3:  Continue rodding/pouring root killer with current setup ($250ish plus weed killer plus constant worry that it's not enough)

naujag,Lowe's tile installation problems ... wrong grout used?,"We recently ordered tile and installation from Lowe's for our bedroom and bathroom here in Florida. We picked the Woods French Gray tile and Pewter colored grout by MAPEI Ultracolor Plus FA that is supposed to have high stain resistance and no sealing required.

There are some problems with the installation. Several of the tiles sound very hollow when you tap them, which I think means that they didn't bond to the concrete subfloor. The entire floor was covered in thick grout haze and grout blobs. I spent hours scrubbing and ended up using Aqua Mix Nanoscrub and got most of it off. The grout size is 3/16 to 1/4. I wish the installer had asked beforehand what it should be, because it looks bad with this wood-like tile. The tiles should be closer together. There are lots of little holes in the grout. But worst of all the grout is not the right color. We had picked a darker color and this is very light grey.

Here are some pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/atzuc93](https://imgur.com/a/atzuc93)

When you put some water on this new grout it absorbs it and stays a much darker color for hours. See the 4th picture. It stays wet longest around the tiny holes. And when you rub the wet grout it comes off easily.

Is that normal? I don't think that they used the self-sealing MAPEI Pewter grout that we ordered. The grout is also much finer than the more sandier grout that we have in other rooms. It is almost like they used the mortar as grout, as it is pretty much the color of the mortar.

Unfortunately there was no grout leftover. The installers left the mortar bags and there was a lot of mortar left over, but they took away all the grout bags.

Any grout experts here that know what went wrong here? Could they have mixed the grout wrong, added too much water, mixed it too much ... ?

I called Lowe's Installation Services and they put in a work order to the installer to come back. After several days they finally called, but they can't come out for 2 weeks because all their people are busy. They will fix the hollow tiles and the grout holes, but say they can't do anything about the color. They suggested I get someone to seal it if I am concerned about it absorbing water.",8,1,HomeImprovement,2191
nauhih,Replacing a dishwasher - specs/measurement confusion. HELP,"Hi there,My partner and I are looking at replacing our current dishwasher as it's very loud and more than 12+ years old.  We've run into confusion in regard to the measurements for possible replacements.  Let me explain:Our current ""cutout' measurement for the dishwasher is 24"" Wide, 34 1/16"" tall, and 24 1/2"" deep.

We've found several Samsung replacement models we like but are confused by how they measure their product.  For instance on their [Smart Linear Wash](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/dishwashers/linear-wash/linear-wash-39dba-dishwasher-in-stainless-steel-dw80r9950us-aa/#benefits) it says the product dimensions are 25"" D x 33.9"" H x 23.9"" W.   Sounds good, until I look below where it says:**Cutout Dimensions:**

**Width - Min:** 24""

**Height - Min :** 34.1""

**Depth - Min:** 24""

From the dishwasher manual it says on [page 11](http://pdf.lowes.com/installationguides/887276296647_install.pdf) that the specs on their website (33.9""H) is correct, but then on the following page 12 it says that ""the cabinet must be at least 24 inches wide, 24 inches deep, and 34 1/8"" high"".

**Why is the height minimum  on page 12 different than the actual dishwasher specs? Would this fit in my space?**  I'd hate to buy it to only find out that .1"" really mattered, when the plans make it look like it doesn't? Is this to account for the adjustable feet?

naub1n,Framing non-load bearing wall on fire cut joists..,"Hello everyone,   


Quick Info:

\-Home is a 1951 solid (double) brick 1.5 story in Toronto Ontario.

\-Joists are sitting about 16"" OC

\-Joists are fire cut on the ends against the exterior walls  


I have a question regarding building a non load bearing wall on fire cut joists where the top edge of the joist is about 3"" or so away from the exterior wall (the subfloor also sits 3"" away from the exterior wall, as seen in the first pic).

The original floor setup consists of 2x8x12 joists that has one end siting on cinderblock walls and the other end sitting on a Steel I beam (the joists span half the width of the home).

The problem is that the end of the joists which sits on the exterior wall (cinder blocks) have been fire cut and the top part of the joist does not sit flush with the exterior wall. As such, the subfloor extends to the ends of the joist, which leaves a gap of about 3"" or so between the subfloor and the exterior walls. 

The exterior walls are framed with 2x1 wood nailed flat to the blocks, with sheetrock affixed to the 2x1's. The exterior walls sheetrock is basically floating over the subfloor, hanging off the 2x1's nailed to the masonry (brick) walls. 

&#x200B;

I would like to know what would be the best way to frame a new non-load bearing wall over the part of the floor that has no joist to rest on? I would be framing a 2x4 or 2x3 wall with top/bottom plates. I will be installing new plywood over the existing subfloor, and was thinking of having the plywood extend over to the wall. My concerner however is that the framed walls would sag as the 3"" edge of the plywood would not be resting on anything.. 

There is a section of the kitchen that was renovated and the way they fixed this issue was by placing small pieces of wood that have the bottom end resting on the lip of the cement blocks. Would this be the best way to tackle this issue?  


This is my first post here, and also my first home.. please be gentle

natu7j,Kitchen Plumbing pressed up against drywall,"Update: see pictures

https://imgur.com/gallery/5aTX1aY

When tearing down the kitchen we took advantage of the open space to put in a new hvac run but it meant that we had to add an inch or so tothe studs so that the drywall cleared the ductwork.  As a result the copper pipes that rise out of the floor to supply the kitchen sink are now only about 1/4 inch from the drywall. 

We haven’t tiled the floor and still need to put in the cabinets and a Y valve to connect to a dishwasher and but are concerned whether this is enough space. It looks like the backer board of the ikea cabinets is a flimsy cardboard stuff that likely won’t get in the way but we may need to make a cut right at the back of the cabinet bottom to make it work. The copper is pretty rigid but rises 23 inches out of the floor so there’s a bit of wiggle room there as well. 

Would you folks make due with the situation or would you take advantage of the stripped down state of the kitchen and open up the joist bay, cut back the copper and bring it all forward a couple inches away from the wall and cabinet?

Last year, I cut down some trees near my  home and cut the logs into smaller segments for splitting. The wood was  stored about 15-20 feet from my house. Yesterday, I decided it was time  to split the wood. When I did, I found evidence of termite activity in  two of the sections that were touching the ground. I panicked. I did an  inspection of my house myself, but didn't find any evidence of termite  activity. I called a bunch of pest control companies, with Terminix  being able to come out the next day to do an inspection.  Sadly, the  inspector found some minor signs of early activity in the basement  today. The good news is that it looks like that the entry was more  recent, and very little damage has been done. The inspector said I was  ""very lucky"" to have caught this early and that I did my self a service  calling for an inspection.

I  witnessed the damage myself. There was a small amount of some dry mud  (hardly any) coming out from beanth a board which was beneath a window  in the basement. The board sat on top of the sil (spelling?), which is  at ground level. When we pulled up the board, we found some more dry mud  and a hole/entry point. All the wood in the area was still structurally  very strong, and there were no signs of termintes anywhere else in the  basement.

I was quoted $499 down,  $99 a month for the next year, and $25 a month for the year following  ($1800 total) to do this: Spray the affected area of the sil, and set  bait traps around my home so that the termites fleeing the house will  eat the bait and take it back to the colony.

I  want to act quickly, but I want to make sure I'm hiring the right  company and getting a fair deal. A pest control guy I've used for other  minor issues said he'd do the work for $1000, but that Terminix would do  check-ups more frequently and offer a better warranty of their work.

narbpy,How can I attach large wooden storms to house?,"My front entryway has five large old wooden windows around the door. These windows are recessed, and each has a wooden storm window designed to sit flush with the exterior trim. I'm refurbishing the windows and storms. 

The storms were attached simply by driving long screws at an angle through the frame and into the trim. It looked terrible. I want another way to attach them - preferably something that looks flush. I thought about pocket holes, but if I fill them with plugs I'll never get the storms out again. Does anyone have a way to attach the storms in a flush looking way that will still enable me to remove them?

nar5yd,"Those of you who restore, or have restored their old windows. Am I on the right track?","This will be my first foray into old window restoration. I'm a pretty handy guy, and thought I had a good understanding of it, but now that I'm started on it I'm getting second thoughts.

Our house was built in 1908 and all of the windows are original. I'd love to keep the original windows, as new ones just wouldn't look right and we love the original trim on them. Most have at least several coats of old paint and are causing the sash to stick, and others the sash is coming apart. 

I'd like to go through each window and fix them so they're all functional, don't draft, and look good. 

Now that I've torn into the first one, I'm not sure exactly what decisions to make. My Plan going into it was to remove all the old window parts. Figure out which parts are rotted out. Decide whether to build a new sash or try and save the old one. (Which, how does one decide that? Most of the wood is weathered pretty back from the lack of paint. Is that fine as long as there's no rot?) Strip all the paint on the sash and trim. Stain, and put back together with new bronze stripping, sash rope, and locking mechanisms. Does that sound right?

On the topic of fixing the old frame. How would one fix this? https://imgur.com/4cQxdGx
I Plan on staining everything, so much harder to cover things up. At this point would you make a new sash?

I Planned on buying this router bit set for the sashes. This is a dumb question, but do I need to build the sashes the same as the old? The sash I pulled out seems to have a double tenon at the top joint and I can't recall seeing sash being made that way.

Here's the situation: there's a small ~2.5mx1.6m nook at one end of my living room that I've been using as a tiny office and would like to close off (visually) from the rest of the living room. If you're thinking to yourself that you need a shitty paint drawing to visualise all this, [you're in luck](https://imgur.com/a/vcdGF4D). It previously had a regular swinging door on it, but that rendered a pretty crucial part of the living room unusable.

Some more details:

* Curtains and folding doors are out, I'd rather do nothing than install those.
* The walls are load bearing reinforced concrete, so no pocket doors or anything like that.
* Installing a regular door on the other side (ie. swinging into the nook) would take a massive chunk out of the already tiny space.
* I don't really need any sound dampening, although that would be a big plus.

So, given all that, is a barn door the best way to go? What would some of the things be that I might regret 2 years down the line?

Anyway, one edge of my deck is 22.5' long. Even with a double picture frame border, it's a little too long to just use one 20' board to span the distance. My lumberyard recommended staggering the butt joints like a traditional deck, which would limit waste. With the expansion and contraction of these composite materials (I'm in Wisconsin), I worry that the butt joint gaps are going to be super noticeable.

The upper 20% of the drywall is still there, and I assume I can just leave it there. There is no insulation left.

I mainly have trouble with deciding on the insulation material but since I'm fairly new to this type of project I'll also list everything I know so far in case anything in the process is wrong or if I'm missing anything:

1. Apply permit
2. install insulation
3. Screw in drywall
4. Smooth over with paper tape and joint compound
5. Paint

&#x200B;

I'm in a Brownstone rental. Over the past month, maybe 5-weeks or so I've been smelling a strange scent.

  
It smells very similar to Carbon Dioxide. Now it dawned on me a moment ago that the scent MAY be coming from my radiator/boiler... I shut my service valve in the room I typically smell it in - and the smell immediately dissipated! it's no longer coming through. 

I don't think that others in my building have a keen sense of smell like I do (I smell everything. It's a blessing and a curse)

Could something be up with the boiler?   


Is it Gas that I'm smelling, should I lose sleep over this and call the gas company now? This is not an emergency (911) I don't think.   


Since turning my service valve all the way off, the smell got better but now the heat has come on and pipes are banging -- honestly it usually does not at night.

naentb,Odd behavior with GFCI outlet,"I have GFCI outlet in my laundry room that I plug my washer and gas dryer into. I plugged the dryer in the top and the washer in the bottom.

My washer did not turn on when I tried to use it last night. So, I ran an extension cord to another outlet, plugged the washer in and it fired right up. Assuming I had a bad GFCI outlet, I went to home depot and bought a new outlet.

I did some Googling, and it told me that GFCI outlets last, on average, about 15-20 years, though some fail as fast as 5 years. I have owned this house for 20 years this month, and the outlet came with the house.

Of course, I attempted a reset to no avail, and a test and reset didn't help either.

I go into the garage and get my line tester and other needed tools. I wasn't planning to do anything tonight, because my breaker box is a disaster and I am going to need to figure out which breaker controls this outlet, and I do not know what else that breaker is going to kill. (The breaker for the exhaust fan in the master bathroom kills half the outlets in the living room too. That's how messed up my panel is.)

But since I had it out, I plugged the line tester into the outlet, and both outlets showed current. So I plug the washer into the bottom outlet and it refuses to turn on. Then I plug it into the top outlet and it immediately turns on. I plug the dryer on the bottom outlet and it also turns on. I reverse the two, and the dryer comes on, and the washer will not.

At this point, I have the outlet, so there's no reason not to replace it, considering its age.

I've read through all the posts about this subject on this subreddit and we're about ready to get on to the next steps with a tentative plan, but there are still some questions.

\-We're going to put underlayment plywood above the subfloor to bring the new flooring up level to the kitchen tiles. Are we ok to use just 3/8"" plywood, or should we do 1/4"" plywood and add a 1/8"" felt-type underlayment material for sound/moisture reasons? (we live in northern California, and don't get too much water aside from the winter; the crawlspace below the house also has moisture barriers installed.)

\-Once we get the plywood underlayment, we'll let it acclimate in the room, then nail it down with staples. If we go with plywood + felt, do we nail down the felt too?

\-We'll leave an expansion gap on the plywood underlayment around all sides of the room. But we'd like the floorboards to butt up against the kitchen floor tiles without a transition. Can we get away with that, or will it likely cause problems/buckling? We plan on nailing down the floorboards, if that helps.

\-Is it worth it to remove the baseboards and trim them for the new height of the floor, or can we get away with using quarter rounds to cover up the new boards?

\-What's the best strategy to put the boards around the stone fireplace? I watched a video where the installer carved out a gap for the boards in the bottom layer of mortar. Seems extreme, but if we just butt up against the stone there will be some odd gaps.

Should I get them blasted and powder coated?,"Firstly, I have every intention of making radiator covers for all the radiators so it's not really an aesthetic issue. My main concerns are the presence of lead paint, some radiators with surface rust, and a loss of efficiency from many layers of paint. I could get them blasted only, but the level of surface rust that some of them already have leads me to believe that would be a long term issue with my steam boiler. Apparently pin-holes can form from rust leading to a leaking radiator...

The price for blasting and coating 7 radiators is averaging 4k  here in NYC with pickup and delivery. It's something we can technically afford, but I'm wondering if there are issues I'm not aware of or if I'm overly concerned and should just hose off the 30+ years of gunk and cover them up.

I picked up a few cans of Krylon 600 degree high heat flat black paint to hit them with. I thought about using regular spray paint or high performance enamel but it's rated up to 200F. Steam heaters can definitely hit north of 212F and since I don't know the pressure limit of my system it seemed safer to go with the high heat paint. Also, the flat black will help them disappear behind the openings in the radiator covers.  I'll leave them outside for a week to off gas. After the get reinstalled (with their new floor valves) I'll leave all the windows open for a day while the heat is on to let them off gas more.

The plan:

Dig a hole near the side of our spring that's at the lowest elevation. Drill holes (Quantity? Size? Placement?) in a 50 gallon drum (food safe) with a lid. Install a small pump within the barrel (Pump size? Power Source?) Place drum into hold and bury with 1 foot of soil.

The cistern would help drain our spring (in the middle of our yard) making it walkable. The pump would ideally be something cheap, maybe battery powered, that was able to intermittently (with use of a timer) deliver this spring water to our garden (raised beds on top of another portion of the spring) , saving me hours each week from hose watering.

I'll try my best to reply to everyone but doubt I'll be able to respond to every single comment. But just wanted to say thanks a bunch, I do appreciate it and I think this is a perfect example of why I love Reddit so much! Based on responses so far I think I've narrowed it down to two possibilities, if it's not actually the dryer:

- Pet hair on my clothing (specifically the dog I adopted in November) is getting stuck in the lint catcher and although I clean it after every use, the heat of the dryer is baking the odor from the pet hair into my clothes. This is kinda gross and I don't recall ever seeing tons of dog hair on my clothes before washing but the lint tray does catch some, so maybe the small amount is enough to be causing the odor. I'm going to start using a roller on every article of clothing before washing;
- I'm using too much heat on synthetic materials. I really don't think this is it as I've worn athletic/dry wick blends (e.g. polyester) for years and don't recall this being an issue, but perhaps I'm over-heating them. I'll try only cold water and low heat dryer cycle. If anyone knows whether I may have caused permanent damage to my clothing, please let me know? I literally just bought a bunch of UA and Adidas boxer briefs that are polyester blends so I'm hoping I didn't nuke them and destroy the material. :/ Would they basically just shrink a bit and not conform as well? I haven't noticed any physical deterioration in my clothes... I'm still leaning towards the dog hair being a more likely issue. 

----------

I made a topic about this maybe a month ago (since then, I have tried all the different options people suggested), but in a nutshell, my front load Samsung dryer (edit: the washer is a top loader! Only the dryer is front load) seems to be leaving my clothes with a wet dog smell. It's not noticeable at first but particularly on polyester / moisture wicking athletic clothing, as soon as I break a sweat I can smell it. I took my dog for a walk today and my under armour shirt and shorts both smelled mildewy after 15min.

I have lysol'd the drum, cleaned the lint filter, vacuumed below the lint tray, replaced the entire aluminum exhaust pipe, and run a vinegar soaked rag through on high heat.

Today I finally took apart the back of the unit and removed the internal exhaust pipe, which allowed me to see into the bottom of the unit. I stuck my special vacuum hose attachment inside and sucked up dust and lint that had fallen below, but I didn't see any dead animals or mold growing (which I was half expecting to).

Yet, it continues... And I know it's not the washer. I have thoroughly cleaned the washer, run Lysol additive and white vinegar cycles with no detergent (as someone told me previously it could be my high efficiency washer not properly cleaning all the detergent out of my clothing), and I've run at least a handful of those Tide washer cleaning solvents through on high heat. I hung dry some shirts without putting them in the dryer and they did not smell.

So, it seems to be coming from the dryer but I am totally at a loss as to what else could be causing it. I'm at the point where I'm about to just replace it but before I do... Anyone else have any idea what it could be??",483,554,HomeImprovement,3377

Other parts still have a layer of mortar and plaster that was between the drywall and the further removal might exacerbate the damage further.

My concern with replacing it is that the rest of the drywall along this particular wall is in fine shape and that a new sheet might look out of place. Would it be worth the trouble to clean up the sheet in question, smooth and finish it or should I just replace it out right?",3,1,HomeImprovement,744

I've tried many different types and thicknesses of rubber and foam weather stripping but it's either too thin to the point that light will still be visible, or too thick that the door won't close.

na3jlr,Would using this gravel as paver base be detrimental to the paver's stability?,"We are in the process of installing a greenhouse in our back yard. I've been digging up the top soil and sifting it through 1/4"" hardware cloth to separate out the dirt and rocks. I've already collected about 1 cubic yard of rock with an average size between 1/4""-3/4"" - though some are bigger. [Here is a picture of the gravel](https://imgur.com/TQGex3c)

My plan was to dig down \~9"", fill with 6"" gravel, 1.5-2"" sand and the remaining height with pavers. I plan on renting a compactor as well. I estimate that I'll need \~4 cubic yards of gravel & 22 cubic feet of sand. Given that I'll need about 4 cubic yards of gravel, I'll still probably need to buy at least 1-2 cubic yard to get the 6"" height I need. 

Do you think it would be detrimental to the stability of the pavers if I used the gravel I've collected as the paver base (keeping in mind I will likely still need to add 1-2 cubic yards of new gravel)? It just seems like a waste of money to have to pay to dispose of the gravel I've collected just to buy more gravel. 

Also, it should be noted that the greenhouse itself will be supported by concrete piers and the weight will not be on the pavers.

We began digging into it and found more concrete chunks with the dirt. Not being sure what this was we removed the concrete, and filled the hole back in with dirt. Maybe 5-10 feet from this area we noticed that water was almost constantly percolating up from the ground in the spring time (especially after rain). We didn't think much of it because our neighbor mentioned that he has had a spring pop up in his yard before.

This year we have been watering the lawn to improve it and noticed that even if it is dryer and water is not actively percolating up from this spot, it will start after the sprinklers run for a little bit. I tested the next day by running the shower for 15 minutes and again water started running up from this spot in the lawn.

I imagine this has something to do with the well but am not sure what the problem would be. The water in the house was tested and good when we moved in last year and we don't see any particulates in it.

na2n3j,Shower Doesn’t Seem to be Mixing Hot and Cold,"Hi all, this is my first post on this sub, so I hope this is the correct format. We live in a rental apartment in Toronto and the shower just doesn’t seem to mix hot and cold well.

Our landlord feels like it’s the way it is, but I’m hoping we can do some minor repair like replacing the cartridge inside.

https://imgur.com/gallery/9xJEskS

We have a fairly standard Moen shower valve. The paint is fairly worn but left is hot, right is cold. The middle is off.

Moving either left of right seems to give us a consistent temperature. There’s hot or cold but no warm. It feels like warm should be in the middle but that’s where the shower turns off.

Moving to left or right the pressure starts low but as you move further away from centre the pressure gets stronger, it seems that the temperature doesn’t change.

Trying to get warm water we turn to the left and then back towards to the middle. It seems there’s a sweet spot where it’s not too hot and the water isn’t quite a trickle. Sometimes this doesn’t work and we’ve found going cold first and then quickly switching it back to hot gives us a better mix.

Other odd behaviour is we can go all the way to the hot side. Switching it quickly to all the way cold still outputs hot water.

Things that jump out to me:

It doesn’t make sense that up and to the middle is off, this seems to contradict other moen valves that I’ve googled. I think the cartridge might be the wrong type or installed upside down - but on the other hand hot and cold are not replaced. Maybe the wrong cartridge was installed.

Our house is older and experienced multiple remodels of various quality prior to our ownership. The kitchen has a lower-quality click-in flooring that we want to replace with a better quality LVP.

There is also no baseboard trim along the cabinets which in this case might be a good thing.

na04wj,Do I need a building permit.,"Looking for a little help/advice. 

Background: Fiancé and I just bought a house in Massachusetts (I know hurray!). We have until the middle/end of June to do all the projects we were planning before moving in, including freshen walls/repair dents and a bajillion anchor holes, repaint every room and replace carpeted rooms with new flooring. We have seen too much HGTV and within a year our plan was to open up the wall between the kitchen and living room (big surprise, I know). So we have her parents over this past weekend to show them the house. My fiancé tells her dad that we want to take the wall down and without further comment he proceeds to start knocking down drywall. After staring in shock for a few seconds I just figure ""fuck it, we've come to far."" Now the wall is down to the studs, we've moved around the fridge and taken out a couple of cabinets. 

Here's the question. We have done all this without a building permit, since I didn't know we would be doing this anyway. Do I need to get one from the town, and if so how detailed do any plans have to be? What trouble can I get into without it?

We had one contractor come out a couple of months ago and he estimated about 40k which included the cabinets, counters, flooring, new sink, and all appliances. I waited 3 months to accumulate the cash and had him out again and now his estimate doesn't cover appliances and the price of his estimate increased by 10k. I'm attempting to negotiate with him to bring it lower since 40k is about mine and my wife's budget or to include appliances. Is this an outrageous quote? Or has the price of lumber increase that much? Or the price of appliances increased that much since earlier this year? The kitchen is about 12x12 for an estimate it also has lead in the paint which he said he'd take care of the correct way/mitigate.

n9zqfd,Through-Wall Chimney Flashing,"My wife and I just bought our first home, and after having a level 2 inspection done on the chimney, the company who did the inspection told us the chimney, from the roofline up needed to be completely redone because there is flashing protruding into the flue. The chimney (from the roofline up) is fairly new, and there have been zero leaks or other issues, but the company who did the inspection said its dangerous to have any flashing protruding into the the flue because it can heat up the external flashing which is in direct contact with our roof, obviously not a great thing.

I believe the inspector; they showed us the video and I can see where a sliver of the flashing is entering into the flue between the bricks. Is this actually a big problem? The sellers of the house were shocked, especially since that part of the chimney is relatively knew. They've also been using the fireplace as is for the last twenty years or so.

Since the flashing is through-wall, we would have to have a mason come out and essentially deconstruct and construct the chimney again and re-do all the flashing.

I'm just trying to gauge whether this is actually a fire hazard, or if the company is just selling me on repairs I don't need. When I asked the company whether it was an imminent fire danger, they said the design wasn't ideal, and that they recommended I fix it. I'm happy to spend the money if I need to; I don't want to set my roof on fire, but I'm having trouble finding any information about the dangers of when flashing protrudes into a flue.

n9zj7w,Odd angles in room...I need a 2nd opinion on if I screwed up this hardwood flooring install,"I'll try to keep this brief, but it requires a little explanation. My wife and I started a new flooring project in a sunroom off the back of our house. The sunroom is an addition put on by the PO about 20 years ago; it is a rectangular room with a sliding glass door leading to the deck on the south wall and an entrance to the kitchen on the west wall.

Here's [a picture facing southeast](https://i.imgur.com/2Kcu3i8.jpg) to give you an idea of the layout (it has a stone fireplace on the north west corner of the room that I'm standing on). I basically have two main transition points; the path to the kitchen and the path to the back deck.

So basically what I noticed in trying to lay out the room was that if I snapped a straight line at a right angle to the perfectly flat surface of the sill of the sliding glass door (using a framing square and 6' level as a guide), it wasn't parallel to the door leading to the kitchen. I checked it multiple times. In fact it was somewhere along the lines of 1/4"" inch off from one side of the 44"" doorway leading to the kitchen. The doorway to the kitchen itself is square to the wall on the east side of the room, but these two are not square to the wall with the sliding glass door. (I know that during some fall foundation leveling/repair, these walls shifted a bit from their original positions, which may explain why).

So it seemed to me that there was no way to lay out the flooring so that the planks would meet both my main transition points squarely. If I laid out the room square to the kitchen transition, it would meet the sliding glass door at an odd angle and vice versa. I plan to use a piece of T-molding/trim over the transition to tile in the doorway to the kitchen, so I knew I had a little bit of wiggle room with how straight the pieces could be there, but that there wasn't going to be any way to hide the weird angle the flooring would meet the sliding glass door. I did a few layout tests with this just to see what it would look like on the sliding glass door and it did look really noticeable. So I decided to use my snap line from the sliding door so that when I got to the door, all the planks would meet it at a perfectly right angle. 

**Eight hours later, I'm looking at my partially finished work wondering if I made the right call.** If I should continue or rip up what I laid out already and just accept that the flooring won't meet the sliding glass doorway correctly. I'm curious as to your thoughts.

Here are some supporting photos: 

* The [transition to the kitchen](https://i.imgur.com/rpkxkUC.jpg) isn't *that* noticeable with the trim piece installed, but I still see it. 
* But every piece along wall interface has to be ripped in a custom angle. Granted, this will be mostly hidden by baseboard. Pics: [start of wall](https://i.imgur.com/qlK0uhE.jpg)  |  [end of wall](https://i.imgur.com/YYZhVhE.jpg)
* That said, the [interface to the sliding glass door frame](https://i.imgur.com/KLmFq8s.jpg) is perfect. But [here's a pic](https://i.imgur.com/JtaCF4N.jpg) showing how far off the angle would have been on the sliding glass door if I'd aligned the layout with the dominant wall and kitchen transition. 

Overall, the wife is quite happy with how this is going. But in the back of my mind I can hear myself saying 'laying out a crooked floor on purpose is pretty stupid, even for you'. 

What do you guys think? Should I finish it as it is now or should I rip it all up and redo it?",5,2,HomeImprovement,3476
n9yvqy,How can I fix my unfinished three season porch,"The front porch of our house is completely unfinished. It has likely been like this since house was updated in the 1970s. Exposed wood is raw and rough, floor is plywood, windows are just storm windows screwed to the outside of the porch (and some won’t stay closed), there’s no weatherproofing. Size is 7’x10’.
It doesn’t need to be perfect just *finished*, and I want to do as much of the work myself as I can to save money.
Plans so far:
1. Indoor/outdoor rug over the plywood. I’m worried the floor has too much flex for other flooring options, but I’m definitely open to suggestions.
2. Put up a bead board type ceiling - either panels or pine slats.
3. I feel really stuck on how to best deal with the walls and windows. The window openings are fairly deep. I’m open to the idea of adding actual cheap windows myself OR removing the storm windows and doing simple screens instead, but I don’t know how to finish the exposed surface of the window opening. As for walls, I would like do some simple wood paneling, but the studs on the lower half of the walls stick out further than the top half.
I am a pretty novice DIYer without many tools but I can follow a YouTube video as needed. I just don’t know where to start.

I would love any suggestions or online resources that could help me figure it out. I’m willing to spend a little money (1-2k) but don’t want to plunk down $$$ on a contractor if I can avoid it. Oh yeah, and I’m in Minnesota.

n9xqbs,Forced air vs. radiators in an old house,"TL;DR: is my old house too cold because someone did a lousy job of refitting it with forced air?

My uninsulated Minnesota house was built in 1918. I think it used to have a gravity furnace because there are floor grate returns in a few places and a raised concrete platform in the basement. It had forced air when we bought it over 10 years ago; the ducts are modern, adequately taped, and all open.  We have 18 inches of attic insulation. It's always been too cold upstairs in the winter, and on the rare days when we use A/C, it never really cools the upstairs effectively either. I think my wife may be getting more cold-blooded with age, too. When we first moved in we set the heat to 68. She's gradually nudged it up since then, all the way to 74. Even then, the bedroom only gets to 65 in the winter. We have a good HVAC guy and he says there's nothing wrong with the system. I looked into insulation but decided against it because of the cost, the lack of certainty that it would actually help, and the potential moisture problems.

We're considering moving in a few years, and it'll probably be into another old house. Are these problems inevitable in every old house? If we bought one with radiators, would that help?

n9vjl0,Kitchen Cabinet Questions," 

Hello - I am really really stuck on kitchen cabinets. I am confused about affordable quality boxes as well as durable finishes. I have looked at many options - Unfinished Kitchen Cabinets (comes assembled but unfinished), Kitchen Cabinet Depot (comes finished but I put together), local cabinet stores (not big box), Scherr's, Barker's, and am still unsure what to do. I have gotten door samples from Scherr's, Barker's and Unfinished Cabinets and they all seem like a good solid door. All use plywood and not mdf for boxes. In talking with other companies about how cabinets are made with them, I do not understand why the so many people say that Unfinished Kitchen Cabinets are junk as they are maple cabinets (plywood boxes and doors).of better quality.

I have hired an interior designer to help and she took me to one place she uses. Their cabinets are priced installed and are made of mdf. The prices are comparable to what I can buy in walnut online. I have also met with four different cabinet ""brokers""; two who do custom builds, one who works in kitchen/bath design, and another online retailer. I feel even more confused. The custom cabinet guy has been in busy here for decades. He does custom and he will also order with factory finish. We talked at length about finish durability and he said the most durable finish is one that is done in the home after install with coats of paint and a topcoat. I have also tried to reach out to two area Omega dealers and have gotten no response from either. In talking with other companies about how cabinets are made with them, I do not understand why the unfinished maple cabinets (plywood boxes and doors) would be considered ""junk"" as mentioned. To me, they seem to be of better quality. They are not made in China, but in the NE states and come fully assembled with custom sizes and styles. They are also 1/2 the price of the quotes I have gotten here for finished mdf cabinets. 

Background: We have every other repair to make on this house (new roof, new siding, structural, plumbing, all new HVAC system, flooring, etc....so we really don't have a lot of money to put into a remodel in the kitchen).

n9s6dv,Insights on identifying possible odor source in our first home,"So my partner and I just closed on our first home...  
The house is a later '50s, 2 story, 4 bedroom with 'hardwood' floors on the main level and carpeted upstairs.  
During the walkthroughs, we met the renters (a non-smoking couple) and we didn't notice any discernible odors beyond what one could expect from being in *someone else's* house.  
The renters moved out a couple of weeks ago, allowing us to begin moving some of our stuff in. The first time we walked into the vacated house, I was immediately struck by what could best be described as a 'fruity' odor. Not actually sweet though. It vaguely reminded me of a relative's basement where some fruit preserves had gone bad, just not as strong. This smell is most noticeable in the living room, but persists as you walk through the dining room, lessening in the kitchen.   
A few days ago we washed the walls & ceilings with a vinegar/water solution. Upon returning yesterday, the smell was still present and we made an effort to guess at the cause. Understanding that often guys and women have different olfactory perceptions, this time we both seemed to agree on the smell reminding us of cigarette smoke, but very, very old. My (hopeful) guess is a long ago resident smoked in the house for possibly decades and then later, the interior walls were repainted.   
The home inspection was very thorough; no mold was spotted but of course that doesn't rule it out 100% and we're in a damp climate in NW WA state.  Our first step will involve more vigorous surface washing, followed by a primer/shellac layer and then paint. (I've also been reading some pros & cons of using ozone generators.)  I should probably mention there's no central air/heat ducts to clean.  
Does any of this strike a familiar chord with anyone?  
Could very old tobacco residue smell almost 'fruity'?   
I'm concerned that the source could be from something a lot worse.

n9pwrf,[AZ] Is a vented range hood required for a gas stove?,"Hopefully this is an east question but I have tried searching Google and cannot get a solid answer above the legality/code requirements. My home was built in the early 2000s. Tract built, one of the largest home builders in the country. Gas was run to the property and used for the furnace and water heater, but the stove and dryer (both of which are just feet from the water heater on the same wall and less than 10ft from the furnace) did not receive the same treatment. One theory I was told by my realtor when I moved in may be due to the fact that the home was built without a vented hood. We have a microwave/hood combo that just circulates the air into the kitchen and doesn't vent out. Additionally, the home was built for a hood and not a microwave so it's a bit lower than it should be.

n9lqbr,DIY Garage makeover questions,"Looking to redo my garage and have some various questions on what to do.  The garage itself is roughly 24' wide and 21' in length.   


Let's start with the floor, there are 4 concrete pads currently on it. No major damage, no cracking etc. They are roughly 12'x11'. Hoping for some options on what could be done with it, cars will be getting detailed in this garage so something stain/chemical resistant. There is not a drain in it, was hopefully wanting to add that if it isn't a complete pita.   


The next thing is general organization options. Trying to open it up a bit and I just discovered slat walls. I was thinking and hoping anyone had experience with these and how viable it would be to just make the entire right wall a slat wall to hang up tools, power equipment like leaf blowers etc.   
The left wall has a bulge from the chimney, just grey brick and I'd like to do something with it to make it white to lighten it up. Lighting will be a big thing for me and the grey brick isn't going to help with that. But, besides that there is a perfect spot for organizational cabinets. Roughly 8' wide and about 2-3' in length. Would using normal kitchen cabinets and getting a steel plated countertop to top them off with be any issues? As cool as these gladiator systems are or similar options, what they offer is not entirely what is needed. Nothing extremely heavy will be stored here. It's all going to be microfiber towels, various car cleaning chemicals, brushes etc but again I am just looking for insight on various things to look into or keep an eye on.",3,1,HomeImprovement,1570

I need some help in identifying the proper name/terms to be using to search for replacement pieces for the following, what appears to be original or close to original, tub overflow drain.

From my own research, I've learned about trip-level style levers, etc. but when trying to compare replacement parts, what I have at the house turns/twists in a 180\* vertical path and not a flip-of-a-switch like motion that most of the replacement parts appear to be.

Secondly, the linkage assembly, has a different connection method (different than current products), my guess is that the drain broke because of a pin that connected or locked the linkage assembly with the overflow drain/knob corroded and snapped.

n9k46w,How to fix up my disgusting apartment sink?,"[Links to photos. ](http://imgur.com/gallery/6KjnVEz)

My apartment sink is very old and disgusting, and my landlord refuses to do anything. It has past the point where I can scrub out the dirt/grime embedded in it.

The biggest issue is the center part. I believe it's 2 individual sinks connected together with cracked tile over the center, which leaks/holds water and gets generally nasty. In some of the other apartments in this complex, the landlord has replaced the tile with a stainless steel bar. I have googled this for a bit but cannot find a term for metal cover for the center of the sink (apparently most 2 bowl sinks are one large piece).

Further, the sink bowls are pitted and gross, and does not stay clean at all. A year ago I (foolishly) painted the sink with a spray sink paint, however most of it has since peeled off.

So some questions:

1.) does anyone know the name of the center sink cover so I can replace it?

2.) should I just retile the center?

3.) is there a cost effective way I can resurface my sink?

Things I've thought about doing so far:

1.) sanding the sink surface down, resurface with an enamal gloss, or with a plastidip [(album of plastidipped sink that made me think it could work) ](https://imgur.com/a/oOmh6)

2.) retiling the center portion

3.) removing the center tile and finding a piece of stainless steel to fit over it

4.) replace the sink (im apprehensive of this due to cost)

After the ceilings were gyproc’d we had new insulation blown into the attic.  The basement walls are all 90% below ground and they’ve mostly all been insulated with spray foam insulation.   

We removed our oil fired furnace, and installed a Tempstar 3 ton TSH6 quiet comfort heat pump.   16 SEER unit with 15 KW of backup electric.  (That’s what is written on the receipt).   This was installed last summer using the existing ductwork in the house.  We have just one thermostat for the entire house, and it is upstairs in the hallway.  

The reason for this post-it is unbearably cold in the basement.   If the heat is set to 20deg C, downstairs it will be 15 or 16deg C.  Therefore, we are finding ourselves using space heaters if we are in the downstairs Rec room or office.  As a result our power bill has been very high.   (Hard to know what impact the heat pump vs the space heaters are having as we previously had an oil fired hot water tank and furnace.  Now both of those things are electric.). In the summer if we run the AC, it will probably be very cold downstairs.  In the winter if we heat the house until the basement is comfortable it will be very warm upstairs and probably cost a lot.  

Does anyone have the right answer, about solving this issue?   The upstairs is open concept, but the basement is cut up into rooms and is 90% finished.

n9g7z5,Advice for Dryer Vent Routing,"I'm installing a new dryer in the upstairs bathroom of my 2-story house, and due to price and capacity, am primarily looking at vented dryers.  I have a few options but am not 100% satisfied with any of them, so was hoping for some objective feedback or ideas.

&#x200B;

**Option 1: Vent directly to external wall.**

This is a good option for a couple reasons.  First, it could be an extremely short run (less than 1-2 ft potentially).  There is access via a lower garage roof to this external wall, so cleaning would be really easy.

&#x200B;

My concern with this option is that the wall is under a vented soffit, and I don't want the vented moisture to go into the attic.  If I get it as far from the eave as possible, I'm looking at \~4-5 ft which doesn't seem like enough for the moisture to dissipate before heading into the attic.  I'm in a dry area, and the attic has a ridge vent, but we had some moisture problems already (previous homeowner had the bathroom venting straight into the attic) so I am nervous.

&#x200B;

**Option 2: Vent through attic to gable wall**

This gets rid of the problem of moisture venting under the soffit.  It's about 10 ft so with coming up into the attic maybe 15ft max, room for a couple bends no problem.

&#x200B;

The larger challenge here would be cleaning (leaning extension ladder up to 2nd story).  There's also potential for condensation inside the vent due to the warm air hitting the cold attic.  I think this could be mitigated by insulating the vent in the attic.  

&#x200B;

**Option 3: Vent through conditioned bedroom space to the gable wall**

Same run as Option 2, but under the ceiling instead of in the attic.  Gets rid of fear of condensation in the attic, no fear of vending under soffit.

&#x200B;

Still have the challenge of cleaning on the same wall, and aesthetics aren't great but I could probably go for an ""industrial"" look.

&#x200B;

**Final options/thoughts:**

I could potentially come out of the external wall (Option 1) and come out around the eave, or could do a vertical vent through the roof.  I'm not in love with either of these options (hard to clean, sounds like vertical runs are prone to even more condensation) but I suppose could be convinced.  

&#x200B;

n9egbo,The story of the reversed hot / ground. A tip to anyone who has seemingly electrical issues.,"**I called an electrician and they said they were going to come out. Then blew me off.**

We bought a house in December and right when we moved in we took down the wood paneling on one of our living room walls. It was painted and looked fine but the hallow cavity amplified my SO's voice as they worked from home. HIPAA was at play so we took it down and insulated with rock wool. While I had it open I branched off of the one outlet on that wall and ran some for a TV and two more into the room that shares the wall for our printer and whatever else might be needed in the office. 

*Anyway*, it's been a couple of months and everything has been perfect. Until this morning. We tried asking Alexa something and it didn't respond. I tested the outlet and it had no power. I checked the office--no power. The only thing I have done in the past 30 or so days is remove the breaker box cover to check for any air leaks because I'm getting insulation soon. 

I started to check for any loose wires on the outlet that wasn't working. As I was doing that (with the breaker off) the damn ground wire shocked me! I know just enough electrical to get into trouble so I had no idea what was going on. I turned off every breaker until that didn't shock me anymore and I wired it back up and turned them on again. Checked it with my tester and it said ""Ground / Hot reversed"". 

I knew that wasn't possible. No chance. I checked every single outlet I installed and they all ready correctly 2 months ago. After tons of time trouble shooting (AKA reading forums) I figured that it has to be an open or loose neutral somewhere. I checked every single outlet I installed as well as every one on that circuit and I did find a couple loose neutrals. After every one I'd check by turning the breaker back on. Nothing.

After a couple of hours of this I decided to think. Maybe there was an outlet I installed or something I touched and just don't remember? I did install a new overhead light in the office. I checked one last outlet in the office and when I did that it first read ""open neutral"" and then as I went to unplug the tester, my kid walked in and turned on the overhead light. The tester said hot / ground reverse again. I was like wtf? I turned everything off and checked that outlet. It was older style so I swapped it out for a new one, checked again, no dice. Turned it off and checked the overhead light. First thing I see is a wire nut grouping 4 neutrals together. I go unscrew it and it just falls off and onto the floor. 

Long story longer, I tightened them up and taped around them to relieve any pressure on the wires when I shoved them back in and hit the breaker and BOOM, tester read ever single outlet perfectly! The problem was in the overhead light. 

For some reason this house has all of the line wires go to the over head lights and then switch legs come off of those to the switches. So the entire line of outlets all started there which I *think* is why zero of the outlets read correctly. They all came after the light on the circuit.

Anyway, I'm typing this for a couple of reasons. 

1) Even if it's electrical, you can still do a fair bit of trouble shooting yourself. If you have the proper tools you can at least try and pinpoint where the issue starts and stops. Worst case, you turn off the breaker and wait for a pro. Don't do anything you're not comfortable with but there's more you can do than you think.

2) Letting anyone with a reversed hot / ground know that the issue could very well be a loose or disconnected neutral somewhere on the circuit. Check every single outlet, every single junction box, get in the attic or in the basement and look for anything funny there too. 

3) If you do fix it you feel awesome but if you're old, you mostly feel tired. Worth it.

P.S. The bonus is every single outlet is as secure and neat as can be. Even cleaned up a couple of dual gangs which relieved some pressure in the back of the box which is great.",8,13,HomeImprovement,3976

I would appreciate some help with some issues if possible.

First, My existing tub/shower is 58.5"" x 32.5"" x 72"" - this is all sheetrock-sheetrock. The space can easily fit a 60 x 36 standard size shower enclosure.

So, I've had ReBath (referred to me by HomeDepot) come over and that was my first shock. They wanted $15K. I thanked them and said goodbye.

I found others who ranged from $8K (parts) to $42 an hour jobs (about $2500 for the work excluding parts).

One guy sent me to a supplier where he buys his stuff and I ran into the problem of availability which everyone has. The lady told me the best she could do (meaning the unit is sort of available) is a Transolid kit where the walls are glued $2400 and a month or two waiting time. I looked up the same part in HomeDepot and they charge $1549 and say they can ship it by May 21st.

Subsequently, I spoke to someone else and mentioned all this, and that lady said the same model number sold by HomeDepot would be lesser quality for reasons of HD not willing to pay a whole lot for the parts.

Is this true?

Second question. Just how hard is it to do this yourself? My brother used to do all sorts of construction but I don't think he ever put in a shower. He is 73 and I'm 71, so I'm a little wary of trying this even though we are both pretty active and strong.

I can't see needing to reinforce the floor a whole lot as, presumably, the existing floor can hold a tub full of water and the shower will not need to do this.

The one kit that I liked and was available is the type where the walls are glued on. Is this a bad type of shower to use?

I have a water line running from our kitchen faucet that used to go into our fridge with an ice maker. However, we have recently gotten rid of this fridge, so now the water line is not connected to anything. 

I shut off the water supply to the line through the valve under the sink; however, the line continues to leak water intermittently--and when i say intermittently, I mean, I haven't actually seen water leak through the line, but we have the line pointed into a bucket and there's water in it after several hours.

As part of the regrading were rebuilding the window well and opening it up yo allow more light.  There was no drain at the bottom of the existing window well, so we dug to around the footing and found a drainage pipe.  Any thoughts as to where this pipe may go?  It is free of blocks and I've shoved a running hose 30 feet down it and not found water anywhere on my property.  We expected it to go to the sump but that's not the case.  Would it be safe to sue it for a drain anyway since it's clearly a foundation drain of some kind or would that just be welcoming water towards our foundation?

I tore open the basement wall and found a sheet of thicker plastic with furring strips attached to it.  In the end I want to have outlets on that back wall, so I'm guessing I'm going to need to frame a full 2x4 wall so I can put full size boxes.  Do those boxes need to be metal or can they be your typical plastic boxes? I plan on using the mold resistant drywall back there but is there anything else I can do to mitigate the water or prevent mold from happening? Should I remove the plastic sheet and replace it with something similar like dimple board? 
The right half of the wall has a sump system in place it seems which should help some, but we've never actually had it run it's always been dry or very close to dry.

n9cgu6,How hard are windows to DIY boggled by 15k bid for 5.,"My house has original late 80's milgard aluminum framed windows behind T1-11 siding.  I got a bid to replace five windows, three of which are 60""L x 40""H and two of which are 36""L x 59""H .  They came back with a 15k bid that is based on Anderson 100 series windows, and includes 2k in subcontractor cost for painting.  

Granted it includes costs to demo and redo all the trim as they said they only do nail fin installs so they would need cut back the siding, install the flashing and window, add in plywood strips for the second of T1-11 they cut, and then install new trim.  But even factoring in nixing the sub to paint the trim 13k for 5 windows sounds insane.  Based upon my reading Anderson 100's are basic mid grade windows and should be sub $400 each, so 2.6k per window seems nuts.  Add in that our plans have changed and we're shopping for a new house and are going to list this one in a crazy market really doesn't make me want to drop 12k+ on windows and out of those five only 1 absolutely ***needs*** to be replaced. 

I've done a lot of DIY stuff around the house, but have never done windows.  Are they really that hard to DIY?  I thought the go to in window replacement was flangeless box frame windows where you cut the old window with a sawzal or oscillating tool to separate the casement from the original flange and then slide the new window in.  

Is there a reason not to do a window myself?  Is there a benefit to doing a nail fin replacement vs an insert replacement? how do the installations differ in terms of waterproofing?

n9bxq5,House with lead paint: repainting vs. replacing siding,"I have a house that's about 110 years old, and it needs to be repainted. The painting estimates I've gotten so far are in the $25,000 to $30,000 range, and I believe a large part of the cost is due to the need for lead abatement. It's a 3-story house, which also adds to the cost. Most of the cost is due to the prep work involved; only 10-15% is the cost of the paint itself. I've lived in this house for about 5 years. I don't know exactly how often I'll have to get the house repainted, but I've read that it might need to be done every 4-7 years, and that would be a huge amount to have to pay each time. (I live in the upper midwest, if that matters for figuring out the longevity of the paint.)

Because of the expense of painting, I'm wondering if it makes sense to instead replace the siding with fiber cement siding. I don't yet have an estimate for replacing siding, but I should in a couple of days. 

If I do get new siding, will that mean that I won't have to deal with lead abatement for future repaintings? I think that there would still be some original trim on the house after getting new siding, so maybe that would mean that lead abatement would still be necessary, but less onerous and expensive? And with fiber cement siding, would I be able to go a longer amount of time between repaintings? Thanks for any help.",3,1,HomeImprovement,1334

n9b93u,Contractor laid tile in wrong pattern.,"This is for my stair landing, maybe 23 sq feet. When the tile guy first looked at the area, he reminded me to make sure I'd decided on a layout for him, since it could be laid in several different ways, and we had a longish discussion about the different patterns. It's square tiles that have a diamond-ish pattern on each with a couple different colors - so depending on the layout, it could look like diamonds, or a cross-cross pattern, or plaid.

I bought the tile and grout myself ahead of time, he supplied the labor and tools.

The morning he comes to start the job, we chat for a few minutes (not about the layout, however) and he gets to work pulling out the old flooring. A couple minutes after he starts demo, I remember I didn't tell him what layout I wanted, so I sent him a [text with a pic of how it should look](https://i.imgur.com/xvksIvl.jpg). Yes, this is where I fucked up - I should have checked to make sure he received the text and discussed it with him face to face. I knew when I sent it that he wouldn't be installing it for a while because he had to demo the old stuff first, so I wasn't concerned that I had notified him too late. I also assumed if he had any additional questions on the layout, he would just ask, since he had made sure in our first meeting that I knew I'd have to decide on the layout before he started installing.

A few hours later, I pop out to see if he wants something to drink or a sandwich (I'm working from home), and I see that the tile is laid in the wrong pattern, and he's just about done with the grout.

We talk about it, he says he never got my text, and just assumed that's how I wanted the tile. He asks me to call the GC and see what they want to do, and he'll do whatever they tell him to do. He also tells me that he has to get to the hospital, because he got a call earlier that his wife had taken ill and was going to the hospital. However, if the GC calls him and tells him to come back and re-lay the tile, then he will turn around and come back to do it while it's still wet and leave his wife at the ER.

I talk to the GC, she calls me back after she's spoken with the tile guy who'd already left. She basically says the same thing - ""look, if you hate it, tell me, and I'll tell him to come back. Better now while it's still wet than in a week when it's dry."" I express frustration at this, as how am I supposed to put my superficial tile woes in front of someone's urgently ill wife?? We go back and forth for a while, her offering to have him turn around, and me hemming and hawing because I can't make this decision without terrible guilt. Eventually we concede - I will live with it for a while, and if I absolutely hate it, she can send him back out to tear it all out and start new.

I hate it. It looks like a picnic blanket, or maybe a [nice flannel shirt](https://i.imgur.com/5xmJEnu.jpg)

I guess this is where you all are gonna say ""just have them come back, tear it out, and start new. The GC said they'd do that. So just do it.""

Is that the right option here? I assume I have to buy new tile again, although part of me kindof feels like I shouldn't have to.

The tile, thin set and mortar come off after considerable effort. I am now left with the scratch coat affixed directly to the cinder that i cannot break the bond.  The scratch coat brings me right to the lip of the current cast iron tub. The plan is to replace it with another cast iron tub.

Bought a new house last year (built in 2005) and have been having some weird odors from the kitchen sink periodically. At first I thought it was just nasty smelling disposal so tried cleaning it a few times which didn't immediately help as the smell was seemingly random. 

When changing a water filter one day I noticed what seemed like bits of food and some water underneath the sink at which point I took everything out and inspected to find a layer of grim and gross stuff that looked like chopped up food bits. Thought it was a leaking garbage disposal but as I got my head around the back of the disposal [I found this](https://imgur.com/xW2q0wo). The disposal is so massive I couldn't actually see this uncovered pipe before coming up from the drain line. Presumably when dishwasher is running (drains into same pipe) or the sink is really full of water and I turn the disposal on it shoots up bits of food and such out of this pipe and on the surrounding area. Previous owners I guess put this massive disposal on and just dealt with the issues of food and water flying up out of the pipe periodically.

A quick google tells me I need to put a studor vent on this or vent it outside ideally.

n99mst,How easy is it to replace this bathroom ceiling fan with one that has an integrated light?,"We’ve got an old house (early 1900s) that has been updated by the previous owner. He redid the bathroom and modernized it. One thing though is lighting in that bathroom kind of sucks. 

One thing we wanted to do is look at replacing the ceiling fan with one that has a built in light so there more light both in the bathroom in general but also in the shower. Lastly we had young kids, so being able to have a nightlight mode in it would be beneficial (although not necessary).

n99mkp,Drill holes or remove blocking? Interior airflow for soffit vents,"I'm in need of a new roof in the next few months. Got some quotes. Only one of the roofers talked to me about vents. 

House is an old craftsman (PNW) with all sorts of eaves. 

He recommended I take out all the blocking at the roof joists (might have the wrong term here- the joists that support the roof) to open airflow into the attic. Or I could go around and drill holes. 

When I did the math on intake air (I need about 450 sq in of air), I figured might be better if I knock out the blocking instead of drilling a lot of holes. I drilled an exploratory hole- the space behind the blocking follows the roof line down and is sealed (see picture of roof from ground up).

Is there any reason I shouldn't knock out the blocking? 

If I do, I think vents need to be added to the under side of the roofline and that any insect/animal prevention would be added there instead of on the interior of the house- does that sound right?

I am planning to add potlights to our living room and family room but am new to ""smart home"" things. I would like something that is wired up rather than wifi coming from each pot-light.

Ny thought would be to have a ""smart"" light switch to control the lights/scenes and also maybe the Sonos. The big thing though for the lights is I despise when things don't work if the wifi is buggy or down.

All of the interior doors in the house have steel jambs. So the scope of the project is to remove the old steel jamb (done) and insert a new pre-hung door on a wood jamb into the rough opening. Since the original door was 30"" wide, I bought a standard 30""x80"" hollow-core door from the big box store, assuming this would fit. I bet you can see where this is going.

The rough opening required for a 30"" door is 32"" but my rough opening is only 31 1/8"". I was able to jam the jamb (pardon the pun) into rough opening after planing some wood off the jack studs here and there, but there is nothing ""level"" or ""plumb"" about it. I made it so far as to put the door on the hinges, but not surprisingly it would not close. I think in order to make a 30"" prehung door work, I'd need to widen the rough opening, even just a half inch or so.

I know installing a 28"" door into the rough opening is an option, but my house also has a couple 28"" doors in the steel jambs, which I'm guessing have 29"" rough openings, and I *really* don't want to go smaller on those. So sooner or later I will be wanting to widen my rough openings to make a comparable pre-hung door fit.

It has an 11x14 wood deck off the kitchen to the back yard with access to the MBR as well. So for a visual, imagine the kitchen and  MBR form an L shape, and the current deck fills in the space to make a rectangular deck. I am planning (sort of early mid-way through the 'convincing myself this is a good idea stage at this point) to rip it out, and replace it with a bluestone/ flagstone patio. The current deck is just one step up off of ground level all around, so you can step off of any part of the deck down to the ground, and there isn't a railing. I would need to build out steps (or a continuous step or transition) from both the kitchen door (double french doors) and the MBR (sliding patio door) down to ground level, and I'm assuming I will need to improve the grade from the house to the edges of the potential patio for drainage. I am also considering a pavilion or pergola cover for the new patio (like either sinking 6x6's at the inside corner of the house, 2 at a little past the end of each wall, and the 4th at the imagined outside corner of the new patio, and then building out a low pitch single roof like a Shed or Skillion style roof.

Since i can't take off the glue, does anyone believe I can put a layer of universal primer over the glue, put the cork over the floor, and then put the floorboards over that. My question is will this primer actually seal in the odor and will it cause problems for the floor heating?

n8u69t,Looking for roof insulation advice,"I bought a house built in 1965. Nothing has been upgraded over the years and first step is the ceiling insulation on the top floor.  Due to the cold climate, minimum insulation for a permit is R38 in this city. 

The top floor has a vaulted ceiling that follows the roof slope from 3 feet off the floor where a wall drops down. Behind that wall, the roof keeps sloping away and the space inside is just dead space vented outside. 

At the top of the ceiling where the vaulted ceiling meets, a horizontal ceiling goes across to leave about 1.5 feet deep of attic space between that ceiling and the very top beam of the roof. 

I hope this makes sense so far. The current rated R value of the roof is about 12. The rafters of the roof are 2x6 boards so along the rafted ceiling that conforms to the roof there is no space to add extra insulation. 

I am looking for suggestions on how I can increase the R value to R38.

So far, my best idea is to remove all drywall on upper floor. Spray foam 1-2 inches to seal any air leaks and get an initial R value of possibly 14. Then delete the dead space rooms that are vented outside located behind the walls of the rooms and add BATT insulation between all rafters to bump up the R value to about 28 or something. By then, the 2x6 rafters would be full of insulation and I will need to increase the depth of the rafters. To do so I will need to either add another 2x6 either parralel right to the side of each existing rafter or perpendicular to each rafter. Then fill in the remaining space with BATT insulation to hopefully achieve R38. 

The result would be a ceiling that conforms to the roof from floor to top of the room without the 1.5' attic space and without the hidden side room dead spaces. Also the ceiling will now be 6"" lower due to the deepened rafters. 

 The other option is to spray foam the depth of the 2x 6 rafters then also add a 1"" layer of the type 2 extruded poly styrene foam to achieve R38. This sounds better to me but the lady of the house couldnt be harder to convince. 

What would the experienced DIYer or professional do in my situation? 

The spray foam is fairly expensive but adding another layer of rafters is also fairly expensive. Either way, cost isn't a huge factor. I just want the most effective and beginner friendly approach without hiring a contractor.",5,1,HomeImprovement,2340

n8tc77,Would greatly appreciate suggestions on fixing Quikerete Walkmaker joints in my patio.,"Good evening all. This is my first post on this forum, so please let me know if anything needs to be corrected.

About a year and half ago, I set up to pave my patio using Quikrete Walkmaker molds. I did a good amount of preparation to my base, I laid about 6 inches of crush and run and compacted it with a wacky packer. It is good and solid. Have not had any problems with settling or anything like that. I placed about 425 sf of concrete using these Walkmaker molds. To say this was labor intensive would be an understatement. 

When it came time to fill the joints, I used polymeric sand. I did my best to follow the directions, but the amount I bought was not enough to fill the gaps completely, and I did not have the vibrating tamper. So ultimately, I had to do this in two ""lifts"" and the results have not been good. The top layer has never been totally cohesive and after it rains, I see sand on the feet of my patio benches. 

This weekend, I power washed my patio and a bunch of the top layer separated in chunks and a lot more eroded away. I was foolish to think polymeric sand could really can span the gap the manufacturer claimed (up to 1.5""), but that's done now.

At this point, all I want is to fix these joints, I don't care if it is labor intensive, I just want it to look good. 

[here is a picture of the first part of the patio](https://imgur.com/g9ARdmK)

[This is how the first layer has separated from the second layer](https://imgur.com/GH5tWeO)

[The other side of the patio](https://imgur.com/zQ4y1qA)

[In this side, the polymeric sand did not adhere all the way down to the base](https://imgur.com/XiuAxhm)

As you can see from the shadows, my neighbor's trees extend over my fence and shed all sorts of leaves and twigs, so I will have to have power wash it often to remove gunk buildup.

My plan now is to use a stiff brush and a shop vac to remove as much of the failed polymeric sand as I can from the joints. From that point, I am not sure how to proceed, but I need the joints to be strong enough to withstand power washing. I was thinking of using a sand cement mix and filling the joints with a mortar grout gun of some type.

I just want to solve this problem and enjoy my patio again. Ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks all!

n8s4qx,Cutting dryer exhaust through cedar shingle,"Hello! 


I need to cut a hole through the exterior  for  a new 4.25” dryer exhaust. My primary question is regarding cutting through the exterior cedar shingles and making sure I do it the right way, but also looking for general tips since I’ve never done this before.  

Bob Vila and YouTube assure me it’ll be fine, but what does Reddit think??

Are there any tricks to using a hole saw on cedar shingle I’m not aware of?  I realize that I need to account for the slope of the shingles but that is pretty straight forward.  

Here’s my plan- any flaws?

1.  Drill pilot hole in desired location from interior to check for electrical/ any other obstructions.

2.  Assuming all clear, use a 4.25”  x 38mm hole saw and cut  the interior wall, then account for any insulation in the way once exposed.  I presently have no idea what the insulation is, but assuming it’s bat, I plan to just create a cross cut with a jab knife (good idea?) so the duct will push through. 

3.  Move to the exterior, measure to match the interior placement, and repeat above steps. 

4.  Slide the duct in,  caulk and secure  the exterior bracket, attach interior trim plate, connect to dryer.

nc2e3e,Should I take out loans or work my way up?,"Honestly reading more into student loans is terrifying me especially seeing as how I’m going to have to take out quite a bit. I was recently accepted into a two year dental hygiene program for a bachelors degree. I am currently unemployed while my husband works. All of the money he earns goes toward our bills and necessities. I’ve always known loans would be my only way of completing this, but I’m not sure if it’s the right choice anymore. The tuition itself isn’t so bad. A little over $18,000 for the whole thing (compared to $50,000 for the only other dental hygiene program in my area). It’s other costs that really start adding up. It’s about $7,000 for supplies such as books and uniforms. A little over $2,000 for boards to be licensed. They also require health insurance, which I don’t have and through the school for a year it was just under $4,000 and I’d need two years worth. I’m already struggling to find the money for random costs they have (enrollment fee of $200, parking fee of $100, application fee of $75). That may not seem like much to some but as i said all of our money goes to bills and necessities with nothing left over, honestly we barely have enough for that. So trying to total all of this up seems like it’s way more than I was hoping. I had a backup plan for a dental assisting program in case I wasn’t accepted. Sure it wouldn’t pay nearly as much, but it’d leave me completely debt free (right under $6000 for everything, tuition and supplies). I was thinking maybe I could pursue the dental assisting and save up to be more prepared and maybe even land a job somewhere where they’d be willing to help pay some of the costs. I’m honestly lost and so overwhelmed. Can someone offer any advice?",5,1,StudentLoans,1730

2. I currently have \~185K in student loans (\~83K in private loans, i do not plan on refinancing federal at this point)

nbunuh,Can anyone recommend a student loan planner?,"I want to sit down with a ""student loan professional"" to get a second opinion on my long-term payoff strategy. I've heard of, and looked into, the ""student loan planner"" website and their consultation is something I'm considering.

I am also interested in hearing about experiences with the student loan planner (or others) first-hand, so please let me know if you've worked with them before.

I realize that this probably seems like a waste of money to most of you, but choosing the right payoff strategy (refinancing and paying minimums vs. aggressive payoff vs. IDR until forgiveness) could potentially save me $100,000 in today's dollars. At worst, the planner tells me I've already come up with the best plan and I can stop tying myself in knots wondering if I'm leaving money on the table with my payoff strategy, and I would consider that well worth the $500 consultation. At best, I save 6 figures over the life of these loans.

My situation is an interesting one. I have a private student loan taken out through a local credit union (Graduated Fall of 2017, started paying off in Summer of 2018), and from my understanding these loans are supposed to be shown as installment payments on my credit report (I have another student loan through Discover that is displayed correctly). However, this specific student loan in mention is showing up as a revolving credit account, and because of that it is associated with a credit utilization percentage (it is showing 95% credit utilization from all three bureau's, and it is really affecting my score with it being that high). Is this a normal thing for student loans? If not, how do I go about fixing it to show it as an installment payment? I tried calling the accounting service of the loan provider but they weren't very helpful.. I have full proof that this is a private student loan as well.

nbp4wf,Is $60K in Student Loans a lot?,"So I am an American that studied International Relations at a university in the UK and graduated in mid-2020. I hoped to work in London after my undergrad degree, but visa restrictions and COVID left me with no choice to return to the United States in October. I haven't found much luck landing a job here since I've back. I have landed an internship in Washington DC for the summer for a consulting firm that works with telecom companies. I have an offer to do an MSc in ""International Politics"" at a university in London this Fall. I would have to pull out about $60k in students loans ($20,500 in Direct Unsub and $39,500 in Grad Plus). Since leaving the UK, the visa rules have changed and now I can stay in the UK for 2 years without a company sponsor. Before 2021, you were only granted 6 months to find a company to sponsor your next visa. Even now, many of the jobs I wanted to apply for in my undergrad are now open for me to apply as they do not have to sponsor me right after my studies. I just can't apply for them yet as I need to be in the UK when applying for these positions. I do feel like $60k in student loans is a lot, but the opportunity to complete my master's degree in one year is appealing and I am in a location that offers a lot of opportunities in my chosen career field. With the money I have saved from my summer internship, a small amount of savings from a previous job, and I plan to work alongside my studies, I feel like I can handle this amount of debt. Granted, I will be living in London which is super expensive and who knows what the job market will be like in 2022/23. Furthermore, I have spoken to a number of individuals in my chosen career field and they almost all agree that a master's degree is well worth it despite the immediate financial burden. 

A few details about me: I am 23 years old and I am really interested in working in management consultancy and then eventually working for an international organisation like NATO or the UNFCCC. Many of the positions within these organisations require a master's degree before applying which is also why I am seeking to continue my studies. Also, with my student visa, I can work a total of 20 hours a week max during term-time. I have some experience working during my studies already as I did an internship during my final year of undergrad where I worked 2 days a week at a nearby company. I wanted to continue working for them, but they were not licensed to sponsor work visas.

Me: All Federal Loans on IBR. I work part-time as an associate in addition to starting my own business (S-Corps) that is just now making some money so I can pay myself. If business continues to grow, I can quit the part-time job and focus on my business full time, while paying myself as an employee of the corporation.

I've been in contact with my college about this.

Basically, I'm (21, m) living with my friend at the moment because I can't afford rent or a house. I lived in a house with my family this time last year, but they couldn't afford to make payments and the house was foreclosed. They had to live with my uncle, and their house wasn't big enough for the three of us so my friend let me stay with her. I provided documentation that my house was foreclosed, but one of the counselors told me they probably won't qualify that as homelessness.

I don't stay at a shelter because I have a friend who is letting me live with her, but it seems like that may be the only documentation they take. Is there any way around this? One counselor mentioned something like a dependency override? But I'm not sure if that would apply to me.

I don't know what to do. I file my taxes independently, I pay for all of my own expenses (phone bill, etc), but I won't be able to afford my final year of college because of this, unless I am able to attain independency to the FAFSA.

Should I try and get paperwork from a homeless shelter proving it? Is there another option I can take?

nad1k9,Is $40k+ in undergrad loans a lot,"I am a current junior in HS looking at colleges and the thing that concerns me is the cost.

nacupw,Student Loan / Financial Advice,"Mobile user! 

Not sure if this is the place to post (i’m also posting in r/creditcards) but figured I’d ask for advice here as well since I want advice on credit! Anything would be appreciated!

I’m a 22 year old college student in America. I’m out of school at the moment with about $10k left in student loans. My father was diagnosed with leukemia and my mother had massive heart failure in the same week of my junior year in college so I had to leave school to take care of them and had to pick up a full time job to help pay on bills like my car insurance (my car is paid off), student loans, food, phone (which they were helping me pay on before hand) and help them pay on their own bills since I am living with them again. 

I was ready to return to school and then covid hit and everything shut down. Classes have since reopened but I’m not sure what to do. I still have the credits from all my classes but I’ve been looking at going to a local community college to get a degree or an assistance program that my state offers. I’ve never been great at school and I’m worried that with my full time job i wouldn’t be able to devote myself to my classes fully OR if I quit my job to go back to school then the money I have saved will eventually run out and I wouldn’t be able to help my parents (as they have become dependent on my financial support every month) or pay for my own needs. On top of this, I’m currently looking for a new (preferably higher paying) job so I can leave my current one that i’ve been at for about 2.5 years. 

A big obstacle for me as of this moment is waiting to see if the government does any sort of student debt relief. I got my stimulus money back when I filed taxes and I actually got some money back from the state. Since the student loans don’t have interest on them right now I know the smart thing to do would be to put what money i can from income and the stimulus/tax return into savings and let it build interest so if the government doesn’t relieve any student debt then i can just pay it off. 

My girlfriend has lead me to come and ask on this sub and I see how she didn’t go to college but her mother is very smart and has earned her a lot of money in the stock market (invested $5k and currently has $13k worth of stocks) and she doesn’t have any student loans as she hasn’t attended college (she’s 21) and she’s a manager of a sport health facility making ~$30k a year and she’s already looking at buying a house, she just bought a tesla and uses a credit card to buy everything and had a 700 FICO score and is building credit. Im currently making ~$25k a year as a shift leader in the same sport health facility with a 680 FICO. I don’t have a credit card because my parents always shunned them since they had over $40k in credit card debt but i see my sister (35) and girlfriend use them for everyday purposes. 

I have no idea what kind of card would be good for me or banks that accept people in my situation. I know it can be a very useful tool to help build credit if you pay it off instantly. I have been playing with the idea of opening a Roth ira since I am thinking about my future but I don’t know much about any of this sort of stuff

I know a lot of this was personal and may not belong on this page but I really would like some opinions or advice whether someone has been in this exact situation or just has some insight on good decisions i should make. thank you for your time.",2,0,StudentLoans,3444

Husband got into medical school in Australia in 2020 but we are having a nightmare of a time trying to get financial aid. We are U.S citizens. Here's the catch, this particular school doesn't take Federal loans. It wouldn't be enough anyway at only 20k U.S.D a year and school is 30k a year. The only lender is Sallie Mae who requires U.S citizen to co-sign. I co-signed it because my credit score is 825/850 so it's pretty damn good but I only make 40k. His was credit score was 690 and had been employed with current job for 5 months with 65k earnings with solid work history. The loan was denied for 75k which is a year of medical school and 15k to move internationally and cover 6 months of expenses so we can get settled. We don't have collateral like a house. At the time, I had 25k in IRA and 6k in savings (I hold our savings because I'm better with money). No CD accounts and only had been employed with current job for 4 months but solid job history. Since he doesn't have anyone in his family without overextended credit/bad credit, he had to defer medical school for a year because we couldn't get loan. 

Nearly a year later, I have 30k saved and 27k in IRA, low debt to income ratio, 820 credit score, 14 months at current job. His credit score is now 770 with 15 months of 65k job.

I understand that PLUS loans are the sole responsibility of the parent but when I asked my mom to take them out on behalf of me, it has always been understood that I will be the one paying it all off, in full. This is due to the fact that she is not in a high paying job and assuming I get a good job with my degree, I will be making exponentially more than my mom. 

When it comes time for payments that need to be made, how will I show that I did this, in the legal sense, such as taxes or whatever? It says that plus loans are the sole responsibility of the parent but is it technically “illegal” if i, as not the parent but the student, make payments? Or would I need to be transferring the money so she can pay in her name, etc? I hope I’m making sense. This is not a dire situation but I just want to be sure I’m prepared since it will be coming up this fall.

n8trkl,Advice for convincing parents to hold off on paying the parent plus loans until September? I am expected to pay them back.,"A bit of background: 

1. My parents took PP Loans out that I had agreed to pay back - the total amount right now, excluding interest, is $33k
2. I have held up my end of the deal and made every payment for the past 5 years, except during this forbearance period
3. My parents retired in 2020, just closed on selling their house, and made enough to pay off all of their debts - this PP Loan included (switching to full time RV’ers)
4. My dad is the one that relays this info, and is notoriously stubborn. Especially if finances are involved.

To my surprise, they have decided they want to pay off all of the $33k in loans, and are expecting me to pay them back in one of these 2 ways:
1. Pay them a fixed rate of $350/month for the next 4.5 years (totals out to $18k that I pay, and they’d absorb the remaining $15k)
2. I give them a lump sum of $13k now, and they absorb the remaining $20k - this is both our preferred option.

I have been saving up with the intention to pay a lump sum on those loans right before the forbearance ends, assuming Biden doesn’t come through and forgive some of those loans. I briefly tried to convince my dad to hold off until then, because there’s a (very small) chance we see some of that loan forgiven and both he and I end up paying less. In his mind, that’s not going to happen (called it a ‘pipe dream’), and raised a fuss at the mere thought of waiting just a few more months. They are financially fine and are not planning on buying anything new in the near future, so having this debt there for a couple more months really isn’t hurting them especially given the funds to pay it off are just a click away. Seemingly the only reason he won’t agree is because he’s impatient and just wants to clear his name of debt. I get that, but they have an insanely high credit score and have always been great at paying off debt, so it’s not like this has been a lifelong ‘issue’ of theirs and they’re finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. 

He didn’t give me the chance to explain that by paying him the 13k upfront, I’m putting myself in a position of only having maybe 1 month of emergency expenses available. In his mind though, this is ‘doing the responsible thing, and stepping out of my ‘comfort zone’ to do what needs to be done’. I work in entertainment, where layoffs aren’t uncommon and turnover is high, so by waiting until the end of August, it allows me to build a larger safety net whilst giving us both time to wait and see what the outcome of any potential forgiveness may be. 

How do I convince them to wait? Without getting political here, is there any Republican Financial Advisor advice or sites I can share with them when I inevitably draft an email explaining my situation? I specify Republican because politics is inherently part of my request to wait, and any time I mention Biden, it never goes well… they’re Trump supporters. 

Any and all advice is recommended 

TLDR; My parents are paying off the PP Loans (33k) that I agreed to pay before I went to college in 2010. They’re also agreeing to absorb a portion of that 33k, leaving me to either pay them a smaller lump sum upfront (13k), or a fixed rate totaling a higher sum (18k) over 4.5 years. They have great credit and no other debt, with no intention of buying anything big/new in the near future, but are eager to pay them NOW to clear their name of debt as they’ve just sold their house and have the means to do so. They don’t believe forgiveness will happen and don’t want to wait. I won’t be in a position to accept the better option (upfront 13k) until August, and I do not want anymore monthly payments, so the 18k option is not really an option in my mind. How can I convince them to wait, and that the money sitting in the bank for 3-4 more months is essentially the same as having them paid off?",7,5,StudentLoans,3834

I've been contemplating dropping all my classes because I have a gut feeling I won't get higher than a D in my classes and I don't want my grades to further drop my GPA, but I'm scared that if I drop all my classes and then make a SAP appeal, it won't be a good look for me. My GPA currently stands at 0.735.

I've made two appeals prior to this one that I will have to make because regardless of what happens, I won't have a 2.0 GPA which is required to continue receiving financial aid. I have been feeling really anxious about whether or not my appeal will be accepted because I've already made two appeals. The first one was just me simply wanting to come back and better myself for college, the second appeal was because I ended up getting all D's in my semester and I dropped my Winter classes because my Dad passed away towards the end of the semester and I decided to drop my two Winter classes. Those two appeals got accepted, but with this third appeal, I've been having so much anxiety thinking that this appeal won't be accepted because I feel that  I haven't made any progress after the first two appeals made.

Personally, I want to just drop all my classes, focus on my mental health and come back, learning from my previous mistakes so I can have a clear mindset going into the Fall semester, but I'm scared that if I drop all my classes, it's not going to look good when I make that SAP appeal. I don't know what to do. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.",4,1,StudentLoans,1822
n8t2i0,I'm(21/M) new to student loans and have some questions,"So, for the last 3 years I've been paying for Community College out of pocket as a CS/Mathematics double major, while living at home and working about 30 hours a week. 

It's really starting to destroy my sanity and I can't really take it anymore(abusive family that really doesn't care if I have to study or sleep some nights). 

Would it be possible to use Student Loans to help pay for a place to live and schooling for the remaining 2 years, while I work say 20 hours a week? 

I make enough to where I would only need an extra $200(at most) a month for living expenses, but I would also need classes fully covered. 

I don't mean to sound naive, but I really don't know anything about loans for my situation. I was thinking about going to my credit union this week and I don't want to sound way out of my league asking for assistance, I guess.

n8pzwj,My disabled/retired dad is still paying off 30yo med school loans,"My dad worked as a psychiatrist for the VA. He lost his job around 2006 and eventually qualified retroactively for disability for previously undiagnosed ADD. I found out today that he’s still paying off student loans—he consolidated his med school debt with debt from my undergrad, which he was also paying for part of. He graduated from med school in 1986. He says that because of his ADD, he’s been incapable of navigating any process to find out if he can stop paying the loans. I’d like to try to help him, mostly because it frustrates me that he’s throwing $300 a month at this and still has \~$17K left.

He’s not working now and he consolidated the loans. He also worked in the public sector and is disabled. I don’t really have more detail yet beyond what I’ve written, but I could follow up with him to get more information. In my admittedly brief research, what I found made it sound like since he consolidated the loans, anything he's done in the past wouldn't matter, and he either wouldn't qualify for forgiveness because he's not still working, or he'd have to re-structure the loans and the clock on 10 years of timely payments would only start now.

I use YNAB and I've been keeping my spending very low for the past year to try to repay debts faster.

The Pell grant will cover my tuition for the first two years of community college (Computer Science), but after that I plan on going to UNH to finish my degree with Engineering. The only problem is that the loans, if I divided my loans throughout each month every year I'd only have around $666 per month.

That's not enough. Mainly because the situation I'm in is definitely not going to last much longer, and if I'm working full time; I cant study Computer Science, let alone Engineering afterwards. Luckily UNH has granite state guarantee so I may be able to attend for free / nearly free.

I got a job after being out of school for a small family business with no possibility of moving up. I got depressed and stayed for about 8 years living with my parents the whole time in a HCOL area and Barry getting by with bills. They didn’t support me and I paid them rent in cash. 

Now I’m doing better. I got treatment for the depression. Discovered I had ADHD and got treatment in the last year. 

I decided to go back and get a new degree. 

I found a computer science program that you can do the prep courses for about a year and a half and then enter a masters program for it. 

I started out doing it remote and have been doing it for about a year now part time while still working. 

I have about a year of classes full time left before entering the masters part. 

The program is out of state though. There is no in state options like this. 

I apparently hit the credit/units limit of 150%. And now have to appeal for continues FAFSA loans. I’m not sure if I will get it approved or not.

n734lz,Paid off $75k in private loans in ~4y!! Details below.,"So relieved to be done with my private loan of about $75k!

Fortunately or unfortunately during the pandemic, they didn't halt payments...so I've been trying to kill it off ever since.

As a long time lurker (sans account), I've always loved the posts that provide deep dives into how loans are paid off, what sort of lifestyles people were living, and of course data to prove it.

So here it is...

**How I got the loans...**

* I graduated in 2013 with a bachelors degree from an out of state public school.
* In 2016, I graduated with a masters degree from an out of state public school (which I mostly got a full ride for).

**How I paid off the loans**

[Here's a Google Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQbroZhjrd_-HHQq_40ugmZcFRvmE1XYiukWEkt-O3-X75kw1mjsBzzc7rGkPaRUuhZhVDY_VdWN3SI/pubhtml?gid=2092141458&single=true) of how I paid them off over time. (Will amend this post to embed the chart, just so that no one thinks that the link is phishing or worse, a rickroll. Edit: ok. embedding doesn't work here, sorry.) 

**Factors that went into making those payments...**

*Making a deal w/ the devil - selecting a low interest rate in exchange for high monthly payments*

* I started out of school doing consulting work initially, which earned around $70k a year. Living in a larger city in the US and in an apartment (alone) was costly and meant I had to budget EVERYTHING. Still, I refinanced my loans under Sallie Mae to Citizens Bank in December 2016. They gave me a super sweet low fixed rate (at the time) of 3.99%. But the drawback that no one talks about on this sub is that to get that low rate, I needed to pay back my loans within 5y, meaning I had to make payments of $1.4k approximately every month. I did the back of the napkin math and assumed that I'd be doing consulting for the next five years (I left the industry a year or so later. Oop.)

*Living in Europe for 3y+ while working at a startup*

* I moved to Europe in 2018 to pursue a career in a different industry at a small start-up. This meant an initial very painful pay cut to making about \~$50k a year. Given that I decided to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I had to cut costs in order to make those monthly payments. I knew HAD to make and stick to a budget. It was tough at first, but what really helped was doing activities that didn't require payment (like going on hikes on the weekend, going to free museum nights...etc). What also helped was cutting back on going out to eat, to the club, to the bar..etc. I also moved in with my partner to help afford things and we divvied up monthly costs (living with people always helps keep costs down).

*Getting a well paying job mid-2020*

* I transitioned to a job in my same field that paid me \~$90k around 2020. This job has also provided me with the ability to get rewards for things like referrals, which I've also been able to capitalize on.

**Other things to note..**

*Living life is important.*

* While living in Europe, I've travelled to several countries (pre-pandemic). One way to keep costs down was to use low cost carriers like EasyJet, RyanAir..etc. Another way to keep costs down was by doing weekend trips. We jump on the plane on a Thursday or Friday evening and then come back home on Sunday. Only sometimes did I stay somewhere over a week, it was rare though. Airbnbs were the best bet. Although staying in hotels in certain cities was also super affordable.

*Work at a job that you will enjoy* *or think you will mostly enjoy and learn from*

* One rule of thumb I've been following is to only take jobs I know that I'm going to enjoy AND learn AND develop my skills at. (And yes, that is an extreme privilege.) The industry I'm working in is also related to a hobby of mine. By doing this, I've been able to put in the hours for the job (the time and grind), without feeling like it's been eating away at my life.

*You need a budget*

* You do. It really helped me figure out how I could afford to continue making these crazy payments over some years (like in 2019). Start with a shitty spreadsheet that you can only read and refine from there.

*(****Not financial advice****) Investing on the side worked for me.*

* Sure, it's taken me longer than some people on this sub to pay off my loans, but don't forget to take advantage of investing opportunities (*not financial advice*). I weighed up the monthly interest rate payments of my student loan with the ROI I could be getting from other investment vehicles. DYOR though. And don't go all in on DOGE rn. Just don't.

Tried to keep this short but it became a wall of text. But hopefully it'll be useful for someone. Even when the going got tough, I loved reading people's detailed posts about how they were able to pay their loans off. It was so inspiring. So, I'm trying to pay it back to the sub.

n6wzow,PSA for PSLFers: Perkins Loans - BIG Savings,"TLDR: Federal Perkins Loans? 0 payments, 5 years of service, 100% forgiven.

After a recent conversation with program directors from my law school I learned that way too many people don't know about this huge money saver if you have **FEDERAL PERKINS LOANS.** Summarizing the email I disseminated to my class mate's and school staff:

The Perkins Loan Forgiveness Program may be overlooked because it is often labelled as the ""Perkins Loan Teacher Cancellation"" and advertised as a program for teachers, however, it is far from being limited to only teachers. The program is actually open to an even broader group of employment types than the PSLF with a few potential exceptions (may not apply to clerks or court/judge staff attorneys). 

This program is even better than the PSLF because: 1. It is shorter (5 years not 10); 2. It is based off years of service rather than number of payments; and 3. If used correctly can actually result in a cancellation of debt without the borrower having to make a single payment.

 The program cancels a portion of the debt for every year of employment in a qualified position - with **100% cancellation after 5 years**. Again, the cancellation of debt is contingent on **qualified employment** **NOT** **qualified payments**. Additionally, during each year of qualified employment, a borrower can apply for deferment based solely off of qualified employment. Essentially, a borrower can apply for a Public Service Deferment for 5 years, then after the fifth year, have the loan forgiven.",8,0,StudentLoans,1527

Anyways, as I said in the title I received a message from Navient saying that my loans would be entering repayment soon. I wasn't expecting this because I thought all loans were in forbearance due to covid which pushed back payments until September 30th. When I first log in I see the big message that says ""One or more of your loans have been granted a forbearance...""  
  
I currently have 3 loans:

-Loan 2: Direct Grad PLUS  
-Loan 3: Direct Loan - Unsubsidized

Loan 2 says that the loan status is ""National Emergency Forbearance-Ends 09/30/2021"", but loans 1 and 3 both say that the status is ""In Grace"" and that Repayment Start Date is 5/26/2021 then a little further down it says the schedule begin date is 7/12/2021  
  
Is there a reason that loans 1 and 3 wouldn't be in forbearance like loan 2 is? Is this just an error that got changed by mistake either by me or someone else, or do those loans not qualify for forbearance?  
  
Edit Update:  **I just got off the phone with Navient and they said that the 2 Unsubsidized loans are currently ""in grace"", but once the planned repayment time starts it will automatically enroll into the forbearance program. The PLUS loan just goes straight into repayment which is why that one is already in forbearance. So the guy said not to worry about it because I don't have to do anything.

Roughly $75 is being garnished from his SSI monthly due to the loan.  He's in no position financially to be able to pay off the loan, as it totals roughly $77k now.  His credit was already in bad shape, so he doesn't care too much that this loan makes it even worse.

He's currently being contacted periodically by ACS (Automated Collection Services), hunting him down for payment.  He has no assets (home, car, etc.) and very little cash in his bank accounts.  Also doesn't have a 401k or any sort of retirement savings.

Considering that he's elderly and has no plans to take out another loan or borrow from any banks for the rest of his life - 

1. Is his best course of action to stay in default and let them continue to garnish $75 from his SSI?

I'm currently about to enter my last year as a psych grad student. I have about 80k in debt atm. I was one of the lucky ones to benefit from the pandemic, as I made way more through unemployment and have about $13k total saved up, with my bills paid for the next two months.

Here's my predicament: My last year of grad school is essentially paying to work for free. Sept-Dec I will be expected to work around 25-30 hours at the psych clinic, then from January on will be my internship (most likely working for free for 600 hours). Fall semester will cost about $2500 for tuition credits, and then spring semester about $1250, summer and fall being the same if I have to go that long.

My question is this: Do I pay for tuition out of pocket to not take out more loans? Do I take loans to cover my tuition and use my savings to cover COL (I won't be able to work much and my bills are about $1100 a month)? Is there another better option to minimize debt to finish off?

But, is there no way for a particular borrower (like myself) to compel NCT to prove ownership of my loan(s), WITHOUT going info default?

Despite this, I've paid them about $30k on a loan with an original amount of $28k, and I still owe them a whopping $26k on the debt (largely due to capitalization of the interest of the loan while I was in grad school - this loan was for undergrad).  But it seems that proving ownership of the loan(s) only becomes an issue when the s\*\*t hits the fan and a borrower defaults - and NCT/the servicer has to sue.

I certainly don't want to do a ""strategic default"" in order to force NCT to prove ownership, but is there any other way?

Initial disbursements for 4 private loans are (24k, 27k, 27k and 14k (sisters loan) between 2005 - 2007  


I see a lot of Capitalized interest charges. I'm assuming these came from when loans were in deferment or something while we were still in school.   


Anyway, In 2009 It appears that may be when they sold to Navient. But for some reason the balance for the 4 loans has  increased by a significant amount.  Up to 60.9k,67k,62k,  38k respectively. $136,442 more than it should be.

I eventually want to a) move back to the east coast after college and b) attend a T10 MBA program.

Short story version is I put my trust into the wrong lawyer and they actually conned me out of $15k while ignoring me and my loans for 3yrs. So not only was I conned out of $150k by a for-profit joke of a school, I was also taken by the lawyer I thought would help me with private loans. LOL!!! Not actually funny but story of my life so can't help but laugh at this point. Anyways though...

I have 2 private defaulted loans remaining. One I have a settlement arrangement with. I have one more year to pay it off (we worked out an extended timeline as a precaution due to the pandemic). Well...I have the ability to pay the rest of it off now, if I want. Or, I can keep the money in my account and just make my normal payments throughout the next year. I'm kind of thinking of paying it off now, just to try and help my credit start to recover a little sooner.

However, this loan was originally owned by the same company that has my final and LARGEST loan out there. I've heard nothing about this final loan in years. I don't know who owns it. Non-con artist lawyer I have advised me to ignore that loan and just keep saving *for now.* There's not much I can do when I'm broke, so save up and prepare and eventually either they'll come to me or I'll go to them and we'll get it all sorted out and be done with the private loans for good. I'm not ready for that one to come into play yet though. I just don't have enough funds yet but I AM working on it. It's just such a large amount that I need more time to save and prepare. 

**Here's my concern:** Does anyone know, if I pay off my settlement deal early, is it possible that could trigger a company into thinking I have money, and realize they should come after me for my 3rd and final private loan well before they may have intended too?",2,1,StudentLoans,1860

I am married and our household income will be 330k starting out. We have a mortgage on our house and don't expect our finances to change much post-residency.

I started browsing through some refinance offers and the best I've gotten is 7 years at 2.45% or 10 years at 2.73% which seems incredible. My question is do you think it is worth refinancing now to secure these low rates? Or do I hold off given the 0% rates with the CARES act until it expires and see what the rates are then?

With this in mind, I see some options as:

* Refinance private loan, pay minimum payments (assuming < 3% interest through First Republic) 
* Refinance private loan, throw a big chunk of cash + bonus at that balance

n3t5k8,Paid off 32k since last Feb!,"Hi all,

I just want to share exciting news that I have paid off almost 32k(31,500) since Feb 2019. This was a Wells Fargo private loan and I graduated 5/2018. I started working 08/2018 and I saved up about 10k. When my loan payments began in 12/2018, I paid the minimum for 2 months until 02/2018 when I forced myself to make a big 10k payment. The loan was split into one that was 14k+ and the other was ~17k. I paid $8,000 on the 14k one and then 2,000 to the bigger one to get the interest down. From there, I closed the smaller loan 04/2018 and then began on the bigger loan. It was hard but I still live at home, don’t shop much, and try to sell things on eBay as I can. I also picked up some babysitting (minimal, maybe made about $500-600) and transcribing for a couple months (maybe $500) but this all went to my loans. Any extra $ I had that I could spend, I put towards loans. I do have a 401k but I only do 3% and I do have a savings account but this is small ($100 a month) and will be until I pay off my debt. I still have about 20k in private loans and 25k in federal.

So this year, I decided to apply for the amount which I was prequalified which approximates the amount I’ll need without stressing about where I’ll get my next tuition payment.

n3kan6,First time applying for FAFSA; confused about SAP,"Hi all. I'm having some trouble with my loans, I've never had to apply for them before and really don't understand what's going on with my account.

I applied April 6th; and got a Pell grant and some loans back. Ive recently fallen on some tough times and don't have the money to continue. However, I may have really screwed myself on that, because I have a lot of dropped classes from the beginning of my college career. I have a decent GPA but all the classes I dropped my first year put my completion rate below the 67% required by the govt. For financial aid. 


What do I do? I got a notification from my school that I'm on financial aid warning and that I have one term to make it up, but I don't know if I can bring it all the way back up to 67% this semester. I had no idea I was on warning this semester(It only notified me after I applied), I would have taken more classes this semester to pull it up had I known. What can I do?",5,1,StudentLoans,938
n2xf16,Finally paid off!,"Well, after 6 years, 9 months, and 14 days we’ve paid off all 8 of my wife’s student loans. They were all federal loans; we started with graduated repayment, paid extra on the smallest loan, and snowballed after that one was paid off. Our starting balance was about $54.5K, and we paid $67.8K when all was said and done.

After the first 4 years, we refinanced/consolidated two of our loans to the tune of about 26K. Our interest rate on those went from 7.8% down to 3.15%, and this really helped us finally start putting a dent in those. 

Other than that, we didn’t really do anything too crazy, didn’t live like paupers (except for the first couple years when we were paupers), and didn’t only eat ramen, etc. Any time either of us got a raise, or any other unexpected cash came our way, we’d try to put some of it towards loans.

I dumped my savings (my husband and I already had a emergency fund)

My mother in law moved in with us, my husband and I worked mostly opposite shifts (and some help from MIL) to eliminate our childcare costs. 

I changed jobs in Aug (my old job my hours were being cut constantly and my new job offers OT most of the time- im an RN for reference) 

I had a second  baby and only took a 3.5 week maternity leave so I didn't take any unpaid time off (love the wonderful benefits I get working in healthcare- not) 

We cut our lifestyle back (which the world made it easier to do) so we can live on my husband's income.

So I will only have the 34k in federal debt.

I have qualified for $20,000 a year in Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans starting Fall 2021. Tuition is estimated to be about \~14,000 a year, not including books. I work a full time job, so as of right now, I do not need any living expenses paid for but I do live on my own and moving back in with family is not an option. I get a $1,000 grant per semester. and have no scholarships. No TA option but there are paid internships available for my final year that I will try to get, but I'm trying to assume worst case scenario so that I'm prepared. Estimated starting salary after graduating is $65-$75k in my area depending on the company.   


My question is -   
1. Can I only take out the \~14,000 a year instead of $20,000? If not, what can I do with this money? Save it for the following year and not take out loans? Pay it towards the loan while in school? I will not have extra money during the year (from my job) to pay on loans. I do have a credit card with $3,000 balance when I got hit hard during COVID last year and had a lot of emergencies but it's 0% APR for a few more months, should I dump on that?  
2. Is there a calculator I can use to figure out how much my loan would be after graduating because of interest? $14,000 tuition a year, for three years. So estimating about $42,000 in student loans. I'm not sure the interest rate right now but I emailed the financial aid office.  
3. Credit score of 735 on credit karma if refinance is recommended, should I wait until after I graduate or can I do that about half way through?

So I've decided its time to pay it off. I am able (with a loan from a family member) to pay this 2k dollars off in full currently. However while talking with the loan company she explained to me that if I enroll in loan rehabilitation, and complete the nine month repayment plan that the defaulted status will be completely removed from my credit history.

Whereas if I were to pay the loan in full it seems this would not be the case. 

To me it seems like it will be better for me and my credit score to not pay the loan in full, and to start the rehabilitation process.

I'm 23 and don't plan on needing credit for anything major 
(house/big purchases) (maybe just a car that i can easily get a good credit family member to cosign for)
and plan on going back to school asap except this defaulted loan is preventing me from getting federal aid. Id like to go back to school in the fall 2021, but the 9 month payment plan i believe would prevent that for me.

- intended to work during degree and before I left in Sept 2020. Covid messed my job so I had less savings before I left and I couldn't find a job in NL into covid issues

- Moved to Holland. Had plumbing issues with rented property in October. Dishonest landlord didnt fix it and I became seriously ill as a result of raw sewage leaking into plumbing and water supply. As a result the room is unhabitable. 

- Went home to Uk at Christmas, Landlord said properly would be fixed by Jan. 

-Fast forward to April, landlord is still messing me around, still hasnt fixed it. He's charging me rent, still, if I dont pay he will kick me out. They have stopped responding to my requests to fix the property, I'm considering legal action but cannot afford it right now. Getting a new property is my uni city is notoriously hard.

- Am currently living with a UK relative yet if I dont go back by end of the year to complete practical part of degree I will fail the year.

- I am very low on funds as I pay rent/living costs at relatives house I'm Uk aswell as NL property. Relative is also kicking me out if I can't pay (long story...). I dont have anywhere to stay in the UK due to covid related issue and I don't want to sofa surf at my friends places as it wouldnt be a long term solution and I dont want to be a burden on them.

I'm considering having to drop out of uni because of financials. I need a loan yet I'm someone who always saves before paying something in full, I don't want intend to get Into a debt I cant currently pay back.

The monthly payments I’m making aren’t being consistently applied to the interest. According to my best understanding, as the principal goes down, more of your payment goes towards paying off the principal and less goes towards paying the interest. So says the excel spreadsheet I made. But when I look at the proportion of my monthly payments, the portion going to interest is varying up and down over the course of months. I do notice there is a C next to each intesrest value but I don’t know what that means. My best guess is that it means capatilized. But I can’t see why it would be. This loan has never changed its payment plan, never been late on any payments and the minimum (and then some) is paid every month. Any ideas what’s going on with the interest?

So I'm thinking why take my chances? There is no point in holding out a few more months and risking a higher rate in October. I got a damn good refi rate from Lend-Grow am I'm afraid I won't get that kind of offer in a couple months. My plan was always to refinance but I'm thinking of just doing it now.

Pro: I have a really good student refi offer from Lend-Grow now

Con: I'll start paying on it a few months sooner

n1inw6,Navient deferring coming to an end possibly,"TL;DNR - Loans deferred for about two decades, never defaulted but I’m afraid the end of deferring might be coming to an end. 

I have $100k - $110K in student loans that Navient is serving. I graduated in early 2000’s so it’s old debt. I gave been doing forbearance for as long as I can remember (at least a decade ++). With this debt I was able to buy a home with the ex wife years ago by deferring it for twelve months and the bank doesn’t count it as debt for your dti ratios. 

I’ve been deferring it since covid started as I was unemployed. Now I’m employed and my new payment is due in May  I’m currently employed as of March. 

At this stage I don’t know if I’ll be allowed to continue deferring the loan. This makes me think I’ll never be able to buy a house by the time my career winds down (I’m 50). I’ve never defaulted on them but my credit report shows one late for the student loans. I’m guessing it has to do with the last time I deferred it last year I must have put deferring it by a month. 

I’ve always thought that I’ll defer it for life or as long as I can and sc.rew the interest as I don’t see it ever being paid off in my lifetime even if I would start making payments. 

So my question, point of discussion: 

1. Besides possible registration in community college cheap to be able to defer for going back to school how much longer and how can I defer this? I’m a W-2 employee. 

2. I’ve come to realize at this stage of my life that I might be a renter for life if I can’t defer it going forward. This is sad bc I’m paying someone else’s mortgage as a renter. How are some of you handling the potential of not being able to buy a home due to student loans? 

3. I’m afraid of going online to see if Navient’s payment tied to income will make any difference at all. I’m afraid if putting my salary into their little calculator and then they have that on record. For the record I’m at around$90k annually.

Does this mean I can qualify for student loans now? Or is it it somewhere flagged I was behind? Do I need to pay it up?

I pulled together scholarships that essentially covered all tuition & fees at a state school where I graduated summa cum laude. I worked about 8 hours a week about half of the time, and I did a paid internship every summer but one. Shouldn't I be a success story? How did I end up with 40k in student loans?

Well I couldn't live with my parents, and my school estimates the total cost of living expenses in this scenario at 65k for 4 years. Working 8hr/wk at $8 an hour for 2 years is about $6500. Full time internships in my field at $12.75/hr for 12 weeks, 3 times is about $18500. That gives you 40k needed in loans.

In reality my parents did help me out a bit, but I also messed up a bit and took 5 years to graduate - scholarships ran out in the last year. Our system is \*\*\*\*ed. I don't see how I could have possibly done it if I had absolutely no support from my parents. I still needed them to cosign 10k in loans because the federal maximum for loans was 30k!

My Stafford loans have 7 loans in that category and my Grad Plus loans have two loans in that category. My servicer  is Great Lakes. I went to pretend I was going to pay something just to see what it's going to be like when I do start paying. 

Each individual loan has a different interest rate, but they are grouped together in only those two categories. So does this mean that with federal loans you can't individually choose which loans you want to pay more on based on the interest rate? I mean, the Grad Plus loans have the highest interest rates of course.

mzhvml,Should I pay out of pocket or take a gamble?,"Hi Reddit! I've been toying with a few scenarios in my head and would love to get some opinions.

**Background**: I'm in my mid-20s and have about $14k left on my (federal) undergrad student loans. I've made the decision to go back to get a Master's degree. The full cost of that degree is around $50k. Currently, I have about $25k in savings (lived with parents for two years, saved aggressively while making $48k/year in an unrelated field). 

Initially, I figured that I would take out $15-20k of those savings and put it toward tuition while taking out the rest in federal loans (Stafford and Graduate Plus). Lately, however, with all this talk about federal loan forgiveness, I'm wondering if I should take out the full amount just in case some miracle does happen and Biden forgives that magical $50k amount. 

I figure that if forgiveness does not happen by the time I get my degree, I can just take that money from my savings and put it toward my balance in a huge lump sum, and then have a lower monthly payment (and less debt in general). I know that I have to account for the interest that accrues, so it's not a *total* wash, but the thought of depleting my savings that much while whispers of student debt forgiveness are circulating makes me a little wary.

I'm not operating under the assumption that any forgiveness will happen, especially for a graduate borrower, so it may not be a worthwhile risk, but...it's very tempting to *not* drain my savings on that sliver of hope.

So, to recap, the way I see it, I can either:  


1. Deplete my savings by \~80% and take out a smaller loan, ultimately taking on less debt.
2. Take out the full amount and wait until we're more certain about debt forgiveness with the intent to pay what I would have upfront if no forgiveness happens, taking the interest as a net loss. 

I'm leaning toward option 2 at the moment. What do you all think?",8,13,StudentLoans,1898
mzco13,Fell for Skyway Federal Loan Service Agreement,"So a couple of weeks ago I stayed up the entire night studying at then in the morning got a call from this company telling me they can make it so that I owe nothing in my student loans. In my state of mental delirium as a broke and  inexperienced undergrad, I agreed to their terms and was quickly walked through an e-document signing for 6 months of 200 payments to my credit card. They asked me to send a bunch of documents within 3 days to get their services as soon as possible so there was no delay in the process but I didn't have all the necessary docs prepared until today (April 26) which I sent to them via email. 

I finally did some internet research today a few hours after sending the documents and found out that the whole this was almost certainly a bunch of bull. So I immediately emailed them in response to the email I sent earlier containing the documents and told them I would like to cancel the agreement and not use their services as well as being refunded the initial deposit. That email was sent after hours though so they probably haven't seen it yet. 

I also called my credit card company and told them about it and they told me they were going to give the company 10 days to refund me before opening a case.

mzcinj,Covid Forbearance Questions,"Hey Squad. So, I bought my first house in December and the mortgage company wouldn't allow me to close on the house while my student loans were in forbearance (the auto forbearance that they did to all student loans during covid).

I sort of don't want to make payments right now though, even though I can afford it. I'm trying to save extra cash for a newer car since mine is 20 years old and has 230k miles. I also kind of want to wait as long as possible to see what happens with Biden and student loan forgiveness. I'm on the FSLF plan.

However, Google is saying Earnest or Education Loan Finance is the best to use. Wondering if anyone can vouch for them. 

I also saw some information about local credit unions but I’m not a member of the federal credit union/bank in my town. I currently have a credit card with Discover and TD bank. I also do not have a co-signer but have good credit.

Please let me know what you think. Thus far, I’m in $42,000 of debt from federal loans, not accounting the additional $12,500 I will take in the fall (reaching my maximum).



update: i’m going for my BSN (nursing). i have a decent chunk saved from working so i can pay a part of the $23,500 tuition remaining.

but all said and done I’ll have $57,000 in stafford loans and possibly $11,750 or $18,000 in private loans.

my options: I’ll owe my university $11,750 per year for two years 

—-> I can pay the first year myself with a few thousand left to support myself through school
—-> private loan second year

or

I’ll owe $5,500 the first year and $18,000 the second year
—-> I can pay this myself with more cushion in my savings
—> private loan second year

This all depends on how I split my remaining stafford loan between the two year program.

my2szg,Can’t believe I’m done paying off 160k!,"I graduated with my master’s with 160k in debt in 2018. I moved to the Bay Area after I graduated and opted to go on an IDR plan since cost of living was so high there. At that time, I felt that sticking to an IDR plan and just aiming for forgiveness after 20 years would be the only way I’d be able to buy a house in the near future, so I (unsuccessfully) convinced myself this would be the best for me. 

However, I felt like having such a large amount of debt would eat me up (and it did), and I definitely did not want to have this huge burden on my back for 20 years. I remember how I felt hopeless every time a payment went through, only for my principal balance to pretty much stay the same because of interest. A few months after my move to the Bay Area, however, I ended up finding pretty much the same position back in LA and moved in with my parents and basically lived off an Excel spreadsheet. I rarely ate out, I cut down on random expenses on drinks (tea and coffee), and though I budgeted $400 a month to spend on myself, I never used anywhere near that, so I just ended up paying more towards my loans than I planned to. Of course, there were times when I would spend more than the spreadsheet would allow, but for the most part, I disciplined myself to stick to the budget.

Fast forward to April 2021, I’m finally done! I can’t believe it. I’ve been extremely fortunate to have been able to move in with my parents - this really allowed me to save so much. 

To people who think it’s the end of the world: hang in there, as I was on the same boat. Be extremely cautious with how you spend, and if you can, move in with your parents or get a roommate. Housing tends to take up a huge portion of your paycheck, so getting that lower is ideal. 

Next month will be my first month where I don’t live by an Excel spreadsheet, and I can’t wait!

UPDATE: I see that some of you were asking about my salary. I started at 69k, then got bumped up to 76k in the Bay Area - you can see why I had to go with IDR. When I moved back home, I ended up with a 100k salary (I got promoted in 2020). Also, I had about 20k saved up from basically my entire childhood (I don’t remember the exact number, but it was definitely not more than 25k). Hope that helps! Good luck to everyone!

UPDATE #2: I’m also 28 now. The ~20k I had saved up basically comes from birthday money (for 20+ years) and jobs I took on while I was in undergrad (I worked for 3 out of 4 years, part time of course).

Also, when I was in grad school, I worked about 20 hours a week as a research assistant (got paid 25 an hour).

I have not payed anything on the public loans since last year when the principal and interest was suspended. I have been paying the $330 a month on my private loans because obviously, those aren't affected by the federal pause. Here is my scenario: I can pay off all of my loans today and be completely debt free with about $10k left for living expenses, but I want to be smart about it. I don't think the government will do anything about my private loans so instead of paying the $330 every month would paying them off now be the best thing to do? As far as my public loans go, I have heard so many varying things on student loan forgiveness I can't keep track of everthing. I don't want to get into a situation where I pay my public loans off and then Biden forgives 10K and I lose out on that money that I could have saved if I had literally done nothing. I also understand that those loans aren't hurting me at all and I would rather have more money in my savings and in my emergency fund then throwing it at the balance when an unexpected life event could come up (my 12 year old car has high mileage) and I would need that.

mxx9sr,Quite the pickle. Northeastern vs Binghamton,"So I'm in quite the pickle and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm currently down to either Northeastern or SUNY Binghamton for college. I like Northeastern better in every aspect except for the money. If I went to Binghamton my parents would cover the costs but if I go to Northeastern I would have to take out around 25-30k in loans every year. After doing some calculations, I'd probably have around 90k in loans after graduation. Here are the reasons I'm still considering Northeastern.

&#x200B;

1. I plan on majoring in Computer Science at NEU which has a very high median salary directly after graduation (around 88k). According to most loan recommendations, you shouldn't take out a loan greater than what you expect to make after 1 year of working.
2. Computer Science co-ops pay well so I would use a lot of the money to cover as much of the loan as I can. Binghamton isn't in a big city like Boston so internship opportunities aren't as good. I wouldn't expect to get a good internship / make a lot of money while in school at Bing.
3. Because of the credits that I have from high school, ill be able to at least get rid of at least one full summer term at northeastern. (English, stats, elective, calc) I would not have to pay tuition for those summer semesters so in total I would save tuition for one semester.
4. I don't really want to go to Binghamton and knowing myself if I end up miserable I won't be motivated to try academic-wise. Binghamton also has a fairly significant lower median directly after graduation for cs majors (72k). Not to mention I applied to Binghamton planning on doing a business major then doing a master's. I was interested in Northeastern CS because of the schedule flexibility for cs majors and the co-op program. Binghamton I heard has a lot of gen-ed courses which I'm not really interested in.

Any advice would be very helpful. I plan on committing within the next few days.",22,2,StudentLoans,1921
mxnkot,Perkins Loan sent to collections with no notice? Collections agency wants me to consolidate,"So I recently was contacted by a collections agency who said they now have my Perkins loan (confirmed from the ECSI website). I’m confused because I never got any notice that I was delinquent on payments and no one ever reached out and gave me a last chance to get current. I’m looking back through my emails and I guess I got one in may and July 2020 saying my grace period ends on 10/01/2020. I never got any billing notifications after that. The next thing I know I’m contacted in April 2021 that it’s in collections. The collections agency is being really pushy about me consolidating my Perkins loan (2k)with my Stanford (50k) loans ,which are currently in deferment, to get it out of collections.

mx0jgk,Should I refinance? And other questions..,"Hi all. Looking for some guidance from those who know their way around this kind of stuff. 

I graduated back in December. I’m about to begin paying off student loans. I have three:
$25,000 through Great Lakes, a federal loan. 4.75%.

$4000 in my parents name as a parent PLUS loan. 7.60%. 

$6500 in a private Sallie Mae loan. 10%.

Obviously the Sallie Mae loan and parent plus loan are very high interest rates. I’m wondering if refinancing all of these into one loan is the way to go, but I have a few questions.

1) is it possible to refinance the parent plus loan from my parents name into my name? 

2) I understand that any government issued student loan forgiveness wouldn’t apply to me if I refinance the Great Lakes loan. In this case, would it be better I leave the Great Lakes loan alone, and just refinance the other two? Or do you think the odds of the student loan forgiveness are so slim that I should just refinance all of them?

I have a $65,000 salary. Credit score is 740ish and naturally should only improve as time goes on, no credit card debt. Currently in the process of moving and also trying to build up my emergency fund.. I likely wouldn’t pull the trigger with refinancing until December or January. Minimum payments for now. By that point, I’ll be prepared to shell out 600-900 a month for loans, haven’t crunched the numbers perfectly yet but that’s looking like the range of what I could contribute once I stop saving to my emergency fund. 

Not sure how fast I can reasonably pay all of this off. Having a low interest rate might make me feel better about dragging it out longer, but I’d love to be done with these in 3-5 years.

She has 3 semesters left of undergrad. She was initially planning on paying tuition out of pocket (working adult student) but I suggested instead applying those lump sum amounts to her private loans and taking out federal loans for the same amount.

The way I see it, there are only pros to this situation. She would still owe the same amount overall. The new federal loans would likely be at a much lower interest rate, even if the current 0% interest does not get extended. Whatever amount she can take in subsidized loans won’t start accruing interest until after she graduates, whereas the private loans are currently already accruing interest.

Are there any cons to this idea that I’m missing here or anything else I should consider? Thanks in advance!

My options are basically narrowed down to UCLA, Temple University, and Penn State. I am still not 100% of what I want to study, but most likely something along the lines of something STEM or engineering. UCLA would cost about 65k a year and fortunately my parents would be able to pay 40k a year, but I would still have 25k in loans  annually totaling 100k in loans when I graduate. Temple University would cost me about 27k a year and with the help of my family I could graduate from there debt free. Penn State would cost me about 37k a year, and with the help of my parents paying 30k a year, I would have to take out 7k in loans annually to total about 28k in loans after graduating. I’m just not sure if the personal development and experience of UCLA is worth going or if I should be smarter about this decision. If not, what complications typically come from transferring in terms of extra time or anything else and is that a possible better option?",157,74,StudentLoans,1041

mvjb80,Borderline Between Emergency Funds and Excess Debt Funds,"I have about $5K+ in emergency fund savings I don't touch and as a habit I save about $150 a month to continously add to it. I know I need about $1K a month at least to pay the bills if an emergency happens and there is a good amount in there in case something happens.

I have a large amount of private school loan debt at 42K spread over two small loans and three big loans. I'm not in the position to refinance so the interest is at least paid on all three big loans. My goal is to pay off one or both of the two small loans hopefully by the end of this year giving me roughly ten months to do it.

I pay nearly $400 a month and lot is lost to interest, but the loans are shrinking slowly, but not growing either. I'm using the snowball approach for win, by win, by win. I'm not sure if my loan repayment plan has the option to dump all principal to one loan, but still pay interest on the bigger loans, still working on that.

Numbers so far is I save an extra 150 a month and once that's saved I use the 150 the next month as an extra payment. Any OT I get I do the same. And I got a raise so that's about an extra 125 as well. Anything else I can get I do the same. So I try to make an extra payment somewhere in the neighborhood of 350 +/- If all goes well throufhout the month. 

My question is what is a good borderline to stop adding to my emergency fund and try to devert as much as possible to my school loan debt?

I had an EFC of 0 (the poorest you can be for FAFSA purposes). I lived on my own, parents didn't assist, and didn't claim me on taxes. 

Here is some interesting things I found. I hope this can lead to some discussion, inspire others, and help current students plan. Beware, math isn't perfect and there is some capitalized interest in there that makes things not add to 100%.

My salary in the wildlife sciences is 52K at a non-profit. I certify my employment once a year. Still have a good number of years to go and I'm not planning on relying on PSLF. 10 years is a long time. Id rather not put all my eggs in the government basket. With that said, I am on PAYE but pay extra when I can.

In total I had 9 loans. 8 direct, and 1 FFEL that was of the 10% that was bought back by the government. I have been snowballing my payments. I have not consolidated. 

For additional reference I served a half year in Americorps in-between CC and uni, and joined the Army National Guard after having gotten my Masters. Upon enlistment you choose between the GI bill OR Student Loan Repayment. Having 3 degrees I chose the latter. They will pay 15% of your outstanding principle for every good year for up to 6 years. This comes with an annual tax bomb, which is included in my math. I have had 2 payments to date.

\* There were multiple semesters where I was less than half-time and didn't qualify for aid. I paid out of pocket as I was working full time (totaling $10,170). None of the companies I worked for at the time had any college tuition programs. I took out some personal loans (which I quickly paid off) to pay for a class or too. For my own personal book keeping reasons I choose to apply my post tax $7000 dollar Army enlistment bonus in this calculation, as right after school I paid off the personal loans/ sort of ""paid myself"" with it.

Additionally, this graduate program had a special tuition structure that includes all of the fees which was less than typical out of state graduate tuition. Books were minimal. I was a full time ""adult"" working, paying undergraduate loans, and supporting my small family at the time; so I choose not to bother with a COL calculation.

&#x200B;

My biggest take-aways:

I'm upset at how much university ""fees"" add up. Some of these are excessive. Library fee? Sure. Lab fees? Okay. Mandatory bus fee? What if I don't use the university bus? Recreation fee? I don't have time to use the stupid rock wall (although I did use the gym showers because our water pressure was trash). Funny how it was the 4 year university that made me pay all the crap.

I did use the student health care center though, as my out of state insurance had an unreasonably high deductible that I was functionally uninsured, and I hurt my foot really bad senior year. (American healthcare is for a different sub)

It's insane to me that out of 3 degrees each being the equivalent of 2 years of education that my undergraduate university took up 50% of my total education costs. And that is on top of a poverty-like lifestyle. 

Pell grants need an update. I've seen the argument of people trashing on 10k loan forgiveness because ""poor people already get free community college with Pell grants. Everyone who took out loans were middle class"". Yeah... that's not true. 

It pays to not fail. I am so lucky that I never failed and had to retake a class, because that is just cost that adds up. Or even switching majors. I'm so lucky I didn't switch majors, because that is even more extra classes. To anyone reading this that is going to school soon. Please do undecided as long as possible. Or if you can't do that, front load all of your general education classes at the beginning. Or even better yet. Take a year off to mature and figure out what you want.

Life isn't a race. At any stage of education I think paying out of pocket should be considered more. My last year in University was half-time so I could afford living expenses. Sometimes I only took one class at a time during grad school as I could afford it. Better to live a little leaner than taking out a loan you aren't sure you can afford.

To anyone reading this that is considering military. If you do, don't be like me and pick the SLRP. The GI bill is worth way way way way more. SLRP is ONLY worth it when you 100% know that you are done getting degrees. It worked for me, but I'm a special kind of special who chose to enlist in a dirt pushing MOS with a Master's degree.

Please consider community college and test credits (AP, CLEP). Just look at the money I likely saved. Also if your in HS max out on AP, and dual credit if it's free. If your in school google Freshman Year for Free. I got my AS in only 1 year because of testing credits.

&#x200B;

Do I think all of this was worth it? Mostly yes. I enjoyed my education, and while low paying, my Master's degree landed me a good job in a good city. I live a good life and my overall loans were less than my starting salary. Both after my BS and my MS.

What would I change? I wish I would have treated some substance issues I was having earlier on in my life. I'll admit. Some of the COL went to things it shouldn't have that I'm much happier without.

murcys,Questions about IDR qualifying payments during Covid and refunds.,"I have two federally backed loans. One through American Education Services ($11,157.83) and the other through Fedloan Servicing ($74,824.46). I am working on paying off the smaller loan, but realistically the large loan will never be repaid in full. I don't make enough money. I have been making my IDR payments towards both loans for close to 10 years now and plan on continuing to make payments on the large loan until my 20 years are up and I hit the forgiveness requirements and tax bomb. 

I understand that I haven't been required to make any payments since March 2020, but I have continued to make those payments because I didn't want to miss ""qualifying"" IDR payments and push back my 20 year forgiveness period. However, I just realized today that even if I hadn't been making those payments, they would have still counted as qualifying, $0 payments towards my IDR forgiveness date. 

Now that I have had this realization, my plan is to request a refund from FedLoan Servicing for the payments that I have made since last March and then pay that refund towards the smaller AES loan (which I have an actual chance of paying off soon). 

I'm just looking for general advice to make sure that my plan is solid and I am not missing anything. Can anyone with more knowledge of the process check my logic to make sure that I am understanding everything correctly?

mutnd7,Strategy Review - REPAYE into Refinance for Residency with Low Salary,"Hey everyone!

I have a strategy to pay off my loans that if I could get your thoughts on any weaknesses, that would be appreciated. For some quick context, I have $129,000 in federal unsubsidized loans @ an avg interest of 6%. I will be working in private sector and have no interest in PSLF.

I'm a recent pharmacy graduate, but I will be entering a residency program for about 2 years. In year 1 and year 2, I will make about $50,000. Then after year 2, I will make about $125k+ and will refinance my loans. 

My plan to maximize ROI is to enroll in REPAYE for the 2 years I'm in residency because my salary will be low and to get the unpaid interest subsidy from the government. 

I did some math, and the subsidy would cover 50% of my unpaid interest ($370*0.50), which would be $185 while I pay about $266 (based off $50k income). 

Some questions I had are:

1. One weakness of my plan is that when I switch off from REPAYE, my unpaid interest will capitalize. If I have the funds, should I pay off the unpaid interest that the subsidy did not cover for 2 years in order to avoid this capitalization event?

2. How does the transition period work when it comes to my REPAYE payment for year 3 when I move from $50k salary to $125k salary?

I thought I'd share my student loan journey.  It's far from over but I'm feeling good about the progress.  I graduated from an MSW program in 2016 at age 29 with a total of $124,000 in student debt: 82,000 from grad school and 42,000 left from undergrad.  I was in a low paying fellowship for a year after graduating and then spent a good year paying off credit card debt and growing an emergency fund.  Now I take home about $5800/month after taxes and put $3000 toward loans.  I have $35,000 in savings (15,000 of this is included in what I subtracted from my total loan) and plan to throw all but $20,000 at the debt once the Covid forbearance is over.  82,500 - 15,000 in savings = 67,500 with 20,000 emergency fund. 

When I took my loans out I planned to pay down about $25,000 per year hoped to be done by the time I was 35.  Well in reality I lagged for the first few years (it took a couple of years to get financially stable and then I blew some money once I started to ""feel"" like I had some) and honestly didn't think I could do it but my income increased and I got serious about this, made a budget, sold my car and now I'm back on track.  My remaining loans are  federal with an average 6.5% interest and the Covid forbearance is a big help.

I am a freshman and my entire first year was online due to the pandemic, so I stayed at home and didn't need to worry about that.

My school has a mandatory meal plan if you dorm, so the total cost for room and board will be around $6k per semester.

I took out a loan through the Great Lakes for college and I am trying to pay it back in full. My job currently pays for my entire tuition and reimburses me at the end of each semester. 

I previously paid other loans back in full and never had any issues until recently. In the fall of 2020, I paid back a loan and I’m not too sure what happened, but it completely closed out the loan and wiped from my credit score, removing my whole credit score (I did not have a credit card at the time.) 

How am I able to pay the loan back, in full, without it wiping my credit score like it did prior?

Now that I got through to her, I have been offered $3750 in loans for my remaining semesters. I currently have 3k in my savings accounts (that I prefer not to touch) and I’m on unemployment. I have 18 credits left which I will split up into summer and fall semester. I attend a very affordable in-state public school and tuition is about 2k-3k a semester. I wanted to know is it best to not touch the loans and just continue to pay out of pocket since I’m so close to being done? If I go this route, I’ll have to clear my savings to pay for my summer classes and be very frugal and save most of my ui checks to pay for fall. If I take out the loans for my remaining semesters, I’ll have $7500 in loans and I will be able to add onto the money in my savings rather than drain it.

mtqv4o,Choosing an Undergrad Program,"Hi there, I'm graduating high school this year and looking to pursue a CS bachelor's starting next fall. I have a few offers from different universities and was hoping for some insight on debt before I make a financial commitment to any of these schools. I have admission offers from:  

  

\- University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (BSE) - 23k/year after aid - graduate with \~30k debt  

\- Boston University (BA) - 17k/year after aid - graduate with \~5-10k debt  

\- Florida State University (BS) - Full ride - graduate with no debt  

  

Michigan is the best school of the three by far, and the town and school culture is my favorite of the three. It is also the closest to home (Central Illinois), and I can take the Amtrak line directly to my hometown rather than having to fly. It has a fantastic CS program and industry reputation, and lots of well-paid internship opportunities. I'll more easily be able to explore other engineering disciplines in conjunction with CS. The median base salary for a Michigan CS grad is [$100,000](http://career.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2019/04/annualreport1718.pdf), while that of an FSU CS grad is [$66,041](https://career.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu746/files/2018-2019%20Salary%20and%20Hiring%20Data.pdf).   

  

However, the price difference between Michigan and FSU is (very) large. I'm fortunate to be able to cover over half the net cost without taking out loans, but for the remaining \~8k per year I would need to go into debt. I would appreciate any advice in approaching this decision. Are the post-grad opportunities and experience of UM worth taking out loans?

First, my parents make a decent bit of money on paper, but they weren't great with their money when I was young and now they're bankrupt and in a huge debt. Being that FAFSA doesn't consider that, though, I'm not eligible for any Pell grants or more than like 5k in loans/semester.

In my state, we have a program that offers to pay \~ tuition cost, but it only lasts for four years, and I'm about to go into my fifth (and final) semester. Even with the program, I still owed over $1500 a semester, and without it, there's no way I could afford that.

I've talked to financial aid and they said that they didn't know of anything I could do. I already tried the parent plus loan and was declined which led to me being loaned the $2500 out of the $5k that I'm eligible for. Another thing is, is that I go to one of the cheapest schools in my state, and I can't afford out-of-state tuition anywhere else.

I'm so close to graduating and I really need to finish the degree. I was wondering if there was any way I could get a private loan without a cosigner. I've tried ascent, discover, sallie mae, and more, but for one reason or another I get declined. I already work part time at a restaurant and that helps with the $1500 I pay every semester, but with it being exponentially more now, there's simply no way that could cut it.

Does anyone know of any possible ways I could be eligible for more financial aid due to my parents' bankruptcy? Or is there any possible way I could take out more money in student loans somehow? Sorry if this seems like an impossible ask; I'm just not sure what to do at this point.

Edit: If it matters, I file my taxes independent, but I am not viewed as independent to FAFSA.",5,1,StudentLoans,1770
mt4i2t,Anyone have success with removing late payment of their credit report?,"Typo: off their credit report* 

In my senior year, I had to take out private loans. I went to the school financial aid office and don’t remember discussing payment plans with the person who helped me fill out the loan request. This was my first time taking out student loans. I naively made the assumption that I would have to start paying after a grace period of 6 months post graduate is over. Fast forward a couple months, I pick up a phone call and I’m informed that I’m 90 days late on my payments. I’m shocked and admit on a recorded phone call that I didn’t know I had to make monthly payments from when I took out my loans. I pay the lady everything I owe immediately and 3 years later, I always pay on time.

Here is a quick comparison I currently have for both options - 

Community College:

Pros

\- the Honors College has perks like small classes, free trips, increased transferability, and I would be surrounded by intelligent people

\- Completely free

Cons

\- I would have to buy a car to transport myself

\- Would be hard to find internships or get hands-on experience

\- I would lose two years of networking

Georgia Tech:

Pros

\- Obviously the prestige

\- Great career resources

\- The overall quality of students and staff would be better

\- Located in Atlanta near a good amount of tech

Cons

\- I would have to take out a MAX of $75k in loans if things don't go to plan but I intend to graduate with around $50k

Does the interest compound monthly for the Stafford Loans? What would my monthly payments look like if I took out these loans only? My ballpark estimate is I'm paying $250 monthly for 10 years after graduation.

My second option is going to a CUNY in which I will receive around $1000 yearly. The reason I don't want to go to a CUNY though is that I believe the SUNY will serve me better for job prospects and college experience.

ms9ayo,Possible to game IDR with strategic career breaks?,"Hey guys, first time poster here. I have $68K combined undergraduate/law school debt, which isn't bad, but ideally I'd like to keep payments to a minimum. Looking for some feedback on a hypothetical scenario.

I graduated law school in May 2020, and have spent the last year saving up to quit my job and pursue other (non income-generating) interests. I made good money in 2020, but will 100% be unemployed by choice when payments become due in September. From my research, it looks like I can base my first IDR calculation on my unemployed status at that time instead of using last year's tax return (which would naturally give me much higher payments). This alone is great.

But this alternative way of calculating things led me to wonder: If my plan is just to work short-term jobs for the next few years (I'll be traveling the rest of the time), couldn't I strategically make sure I'm unemployed every time the filing deadline comes around and lock in $0/month payments indefinitely? Apparently you don't have to recertify early if you are unemployed at the time of filing, find a job later in the year, and experience an increase in income (or so the internet tells me). Instead, it's just an option for if your income decreases and you need to ease your financial burden before the next recertification. If this is the case, it would seem in theory you can continue paying $0/month just by being unemployed at the right time of year, but still make money in the meantime. I don't know if this is genius or too good to be true, though I suspect it's probably the latter! Any thoughts on this idea?

mrwkc8,27yo with $170k student loan debt,"Hi everyone,

As the title states, I’m 27 years old with approximately $170k in student loans. I just recently finished grad school and will be starting a new job that pays roughly $200k/year (I make a specific production percentage, so this will vary a little). I’ve used extra money I’ve made in the past year to eliminate all of my other debt (paid off about $10k in credit cards in a little over 18 months). In addition to my salary above, I’ve also received a $20k signing bonus and approximately $3-5k in additional yearly credit for continuing education costs since I’m in the medical field.

I anticipate having roughly $7-10k in savings before starting my job and will likely be paying roughly $2k/month for all living expenses in the city I’m heading to (SLC). I’ll be looking to max out my Roth IRA and 401k yearly.

Given the current news about Biden investigating student loan forgiveness and with no interest accruing through September, how should I best go about paying this off? Assuming I pay roughly $30k per year in living expenses (this is rounded up a bit from what I mentioned above), as well as assuming I take home approximately $130k after retirement contributions, should I be looking to pay this off as quickly as possible in a year or two? My concern is the interest rate is only about 5.5%, so I’m worried I should be focusing on allocating a fair portion to the stock market instead given an anticipated 7% year return. 

Having a “real” job and making “real” money is quite a foreign concept to me at this stage in my life, so I just want to make sure I’m doing what’s best. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!",26,15,StudentLoans,1646

mruhwu,Advice on using Student Loans or Personal Savings?,"Hello, I have been accepted to my graduate program and I have decided to commit since I was given a 40,000 scholarship, and I have the privilege of staying with my parents. So I don't have to worry about housing for two years, and the school has a great network with a Professor I want to work with. I estimate that I would have to pay around 65k out of pocket.

I have 35k from personal savings, and my parents have saved up to 20k. I will be able to manage the costs, my question is should I pay the first year with our savings or use a small part of the unsubsidized federal loans? Especially since the interest rate is very low, and I could just invest some savings right now. Should I just work more and try to avoid loans, or use some for my second year? Since I want to leave at least 5k for my emergency fund, and use my work to contribute to my Roth IRA.

In April 2020, we decided to open a HYSA based on advice from this sub and others. Fortunately, both of us have been able to keep our jobs during COVID and with the help of the student loan forbearance we have been living off of his salary (\~$120K) solely (mortgage, insurance, food, gas, etc) while putting everything I made towards the savings account to pay off the loans.

I ended up making about 50% more of my salary (I earned \~$130 last year as my salary and made an additional \~$60K in relief pay) working relief shifts last year which helped tremendously.

mr69x7,What would be the most helpful way to explain to my parents that paying off student loans before their mortgage would save more money?,"For context, to them it seems that they’ve come to terms that they’ll never pay off their student loan debt and always have to pay it their whole lives so they’ve never touched it aside from minimum payments. 

They prefer extra mortgage payments on the basis of reducing 30 year mortgage to a 24ish year mortgage, whereas student loans are minimum payments for life anyways.

Given that student loans %APR scale faster than a mortgage %APR, how might i best visualize that extra payments to student loans are more advantageous than extra payments to a mortgage?

mr1q64,Good Credit and stable pay but excessive obligations thanks to co-signers: Can I still get refinanced?,"Put simply, I've got a lot of different student loans I'm paying. My college was pretty pricey and my parents took out individual loans over multiple semesters to get tuition paid. It's not my ideal situation but when it comes down to it things have so far worked out well. My parents handle some of the loan payments, I handle others (generally the most pricey ones), and for the few years I've been out of college there hasn't been too many problems. I've had good credit for years now, I've got a well paying job out of college that lets me handle all my own payments and save money, my parents pay what part they said they would, and now I've saved up enough money to even pay off one of the smaller loans now if I wanted to. Everything up to this point has been easy enough to manage.

The problem is that two of these loans under the same lender my parents were paying, against my knowledge, were in graduated payment all this time and has now switched over to standard, increasing the monthly payments to basically double what they were before, far more than I (and I expect them as well) expected. After checking to make sure other surprises like this weren't coming up with my other loans, this left me in a bit of a pickle.

Financially I can pay about half of that total payment every month without issue, or even pay off one of the loans entirely, and still be well enough off on my own. Though a greater cost it doesn't personally bum me out too much because I can theoretically do it and I don't want them to be dealing with a burden on my behalf. But my parents keep encouraging me to look into refinancing for a cheaper rate instead, as they want to pay on my behalf and don't want me to take on that extra cost. On paper that sounds great to me, get a good deal that lowers the total monthly payments, they pay it, I don't need to worry. And I've been getting a ton of letters from refinancing companies saying I'm pre-approved to check this or that deal out, so that at one point filled me with a lot of confidence.

Except of course, as the title of this post reveals, to anyone not familiar with my financial situation this just looks like one guy with a lot of debts and money that's not paying it all. Previous attempts to refinance have ended in rejection due to my excessive obligations, even though all of the monthly payments have been paid and everything else on my end should look good. Thankfully I haven't done any that require a hard credit check just yet so my credit is still remaining good, but I fear what further attempts might do.

Ideally I'd like to refinance these few loans under my own name, have my parents do what they were doing previously and return to how things have been going so far. But most places won't even look at me without a co-signer and the ones that will have rejected me. I could potentially get a co-signer out of my parents again but with my ever increasing skepticism with my parents' loan sense I'd prefer to be as independent with these as I can.

So what's my best call here?   
Just ignore what my parents say and take on part of the monthly payments/pay off one of the smaller loans to ease the burden?   
Just get a cosigner and need to worry more about potential shenanigans in the future?

As the title suggests, I'm kinda worried and curious about loans. I want to go to UCSD. However, it would require me to take out loans.

Estimated costs for everything is:  $**34,275**

I get $24,629 in grants a year, and the net price comes out to $9646. The loans they want me to take out are $7446 per year. These loans are broken down into :

* $3.5k/ year for a federal direct subsidized loan at 2.75% interest
* $1946/year for federal direct unsubsidized loans at 2.75% interest
* $5k/year for institutional loans at 5% interest

The net price for my family is quite daunting and we are considering taking loans out, but I do not know if that is a smart financial move. I plan on going into premed and I'm worried about the additional loans if I attend med school.  I am majoring in biology, so I'm not sure if I would be able to pay it off if I don't go become a doctor. Another option is to go to a lower-ranked state school that offers me a full ride. I do not know if it is justifiable to take out loans for a ""dream school.""

I appreciate any help I can get, thank you!

UPDATE: I didn't really expect this many replies! THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ADVICE AND SUPPORT. I will definitely keep in mind the biology major thing. I only really chose it because I knew it was like the thing to do if you wanted pre-med and enjoyed it in HS. I will definitely keep in mind if I really do want to pursue this path through later experience in college and wish to continue with premed.

I also thank you for the loan information. I really had no clue before posting this. Thanks for explaining how they work and if it really is doable or not. Also, I never even had the idea to have a minor in something else either as security, so that was also really helpful.

To conclude, I really appreciate all the help you've given me and now I have a much clearer idea of how to approach this. Sorry, it became kinda more college orientated, but thank you for this advice too because I did not really know much about college before this year either. This was also like my first serious post on Reddit, so cheers to you all!

However, they have retired abroad (where we immigrated from) due to health reasons with not much income. They took out the loan thinking my sibling will pay it off once she graduates. As a lot of the money goes into his hospital bills and the interests are racking up, I am looking for the best options to consolidate the loans. 

I don't think my parent has paid for any of the interests and my sibling would already have about $150+ under her name by the time she graduates from med school. Since they retired already I dont think refinancing is an option. Would they be able to switch to ICR and pay the bare minimum?

mqb39p,Servicer says Rehabilitating a Loan Means High Monthly Payments- is this true?,"I have multiple loans that are ten years old and in default, totaling 30k. I am interested in rehabilitating or consolidating to resolve all of these debts, but I am starting with a 5k Perkins Loan that is causing a hold on my transcript from my school that I need resolved as soon as possible. My school said they don't need the balance paid in full, just ""set up an agreement and/or find out your repayment options"" with the servicer. 

I called the servicer, they explained I could consolidate or rehabilitate. They strong recommended consolidating (even though most advice I've seen here has said rehabilitate). They also said if I rehabilitate, I should expect my monthly payment to be quite high because the loan is so old, likely around $500 a month. When I researched online, I got the impression you could rehabilitate on an income based repayment plan, around 15% of discretionary income. The servicer kept telling me to 'name how much I could afford' and that they would take it to my school for approval, but that if I named a low number, I should expect my school to turn it down.  

My AGI is only 23k a year, so I was expecting to be eligible for low payments. Is the advice the servicer is giving accurate? I stepped away from the call and said I would look into my options and call back. Anyone have advice to give? Should I consolidate instead?

With this new job, I'll have the chance to pay back bigger amounts. Up to now, I have only been making small payments, and I guess it was divided between all the loans, but I have a few questions if anyone can help:

&#x200B;

\- Is it true that all my payments up to now have only been targeting principal across the board?

\- When a loan principal is complete and I still ""pay all loans"" option, does it start to pay off the interest for the loan, or will it only do that when all principal for all loans is complete?

\- Once principal is paid for a loan, will the interest already accrued start to accrue interest itself?

\- Is it better to ""close single loans"" by getting rid of principal/interest at the same time, or is it safe for the loan to stay ""open"" with interest sitting (if it doesn't accrue interest itself) and target other loans?

2. For any remaining FFEL loans, if I consolidate the FFEL loans to direct loans, it wouldn't impact uplifting payments already made toward PSLF on my other loans, right?!

mpfg6d,Are rehabilitation payments considered late?,"GF and I both had Perkins loans which we rehabilitated beginning in 2019, completing in 2020. Between the two of us, on 5/6 credit reports those 9 rehab payments are not shown at all, with ""on time"" payments being reported once the rehab was completed. However looking at her TransUnion report those nine rehab payments (plus one extra for good measure) are shown as ""120+ days late"". Obviously those have a big impact on her TransUnion score, which is about 90 points lower than the others. Of course Perkins info is hard to find now, and fractionated (our alma mater has no information publicly available on this). Question; should those nine (plus one) rehab payments be classified as ""late""? *Can* they be classified as late? Should we dispute or just be thankful that this only shows up in one place?

- studio sessions - my school is in an artsy town and has mainly upper middle class students attending (I'm lower middle), so I'd charge like $100 per hour and it wouldn't be a dent in their wallet.

- etsy selling hiphop items/things I make in graphic design, and then promoting them via tiktok (I might use something like jarvee to grow my account)

-crowdfund on gofundme via tiktok? (a lot of creators were able to net a few k's off a viral video)

- (if I can outsource from taobao before I attend school), dropship on Poshmark or sell to college students locally and personally, a quality Canada goose jacket there only costs $35 + shipping, I can easily resell for 5x that price (downside is shipping time is approx a month, not the fastest)

-buying cotton tees and bleach dying them for others

-applying for more scholarships (despite being first gen and urm I haven't netted anything bigger than 1 $1k local scholarship that's pocketed) throughout the year

With current job situation after I complete my master it will likely take 6 month to 2 year to get a grad scheme.I have already received the letter saying that replacement have stated for the master loan( nothing mentioned for the bachelor one) so it like be 3 year into my loan repayment time before I am in full time job. 
Jobs I applying for are between 19k-28k. So let go in the middle and say I will earn £23.5 for the first 3 year of the job. 
I am 6 out of the 30 year now and not a single penny paid for my students loan.
At this point I would need to be paying off 2k a year which would be earning 55k year based on 9% of income past 25k
Hahaha that's not happening.
But how close would I get let say I get average mechanical engineering wage of 35k and that the average engineers wage will not changed in 5 year time
Let be optimised now and say I will be getting 2.2 pay rise rise a year so I would be earning £47k a year by 2035. I would have paid off £20k of loan that worth 70k after interest.
If I continue at 2.2 pay rise a year I wouldn't pay off my loan with having only paid off 40k , but after hit senior engineer pay rise would likely be slow down anyway.

She will work at her job up until she goes to her grad school in June (shes making $14 per hour) and will have no income from here on out.

I'm not sure what the best route will be for her. I've narrowed it down to IBR, Repaye, and paye; though, even after reading posts in this community, I'm not sure what's best financially. It seems like consolidation wont help her interest rate due to the way its weighted and we lose the option of ibr in the future. The program she's going to, she won't have time to work and do school. My question is what strategy will help her have the least monthly billing and lower/stop interest. 

Thanks in advance


Edit: so I just spoke with her and its all in her name. When she was in school the interest was still going, she has been in school for a significant amount of time. I want to thank everyone for suggesting what to do after, but we have already decided to go private sector in our area 1) because the pay is significantly better than public here and a cost analysis shows itll be knocked out much quicker.  2) majority of those people who do the those federal programs are still left owing 99% of the time. With that said just trying to figure out what's the best way to stop the interst occuring while she is in school, that's really all I'm trying to figure out. Thanks guys and girls

moy7kj,Stressed About Student Loan Debt,"I am really stressed about my student loan debt. I have two federal student loans. The first is from grad school (masters program) which is a direct subsidized consolidation loan. The principal balance is $69K. The second is a direct unsubsidized consolidation loan from law school. The principal balance is $276K. Then there is $65K of interest that has accrued since I completed school. In total I owe approximately $410K.

I have been on income based repayment since graduating in 2011. But I consolidated in 2014 to get all my loans with one servicer (Fedloan). The consolidation disbursement date was 8/2014.  According to Fedloan under loan details it states that my expected payoff date is 2036. Is that my payoff date when I get hit with tax bomb? The math just doesn't add up between the interest that has accrued and the number of months that Fedloan states I will be repaying (211 months). Am I missing something here? 211 months is 17.5 years and 2014 to 2036 is 22 years. Is the number of payments calculated from the date I signed up for IBR or the date I consolidated? Even the interest accrued doesn't make sense. I calculate interest accruing at $21K a year based on a rate of 6.35%. Based on my calculations my balance will have ballooned to $750K.

I have tried using [vin.com](https://vin.com) to calculate the amount of forgiveness and the tax bomb and I get different numbers than what I calculate. I don't know if my repayment term is 20 or 25 years based on what IBR plan I am on. I'm trying to keep the interest from accruing any further once the COVID forbearance ends but I can't afford the 10 year standard repayment or I would get this disaster behind me.

A bit of backstory.
I’m 27 and have been a RN for the last 2.5years. It’ll be 3 years by December of this year. I have roughly $68k of student loan debt. I also have a 5 year old and recently separated from her father due to not being able to tolerate his narcissistic abuse any longer. So that cut ties with him and his family for assistance with our daughter. Ultimately, I relocated across the country to be away from them and obtain a fresh start to life. 

My previous jobs were always somewhere between $40-barely hitting $50k in inpatient 3-4 random days a week working 12-14h shifts. My new job is roughly $85k and 9-6pm outpatient clinic. I made sure not to work weekends or holidays since I’m a single parent now. I also own a rental property that I’m able to profit roughly $150 a month.

mosnez,Finally paid off my loan! (UK),"So i've been on here for a long while now, but I finally got to make this post and i'm free!!

Here in the UK the loans work differently to the US where you don't repay anything until earning over £27k Per year and the loans get wiped off after 30 years. The government will take 9% of anything you earn over £27k so it's like paying an extra tax for a whole 30 years so pretty painful as a high earner 

But here's the catch if you have a small enough loan and you earn closer to 50k a year in some cases you may end up paying back more than you owe through your wages during the 30 year period 

My loan was around £21k in total and I worked out including the interest I'd end up paying over 50% more in my wages so it just made sense to pay it off as soon as humanly possible to the interest on the loan didn't start adding up plus I didn't like the idea of 9% being taken from me on every paycheck for years 

Strategy has basically been throw anything I earn at the loan outside of my monthly living costs which has taken me around 2 Years and 7 month in total to pay the whole thing off until today 

I got hit pretty hard in my industry when March hit last year and all my work basically dried up within a week which is pretty tough so it set me back a good 5/6 months of payments I would have otherwise been paying

Luckily I decided to start a business from September last year which has been growing nicely ever since so I suppose something good came out of last year through all the bad stuff 

I can't begin to explain how nice it feels to finally be able to not have to pay any spare money i've got at this thing from now on!

Still live at home which sucks, but I’ve been job hunting in same field but diff company bc I know I gotta make more money to survive.

I’ve got maybe another $1700 in Credit card debt but have recently gotten my tax return, stimulus and half of my months pay.

The thing about this is... I just prefer USC over BU for a number of reasons. For example, it’s closer to home and I feel as though I’d feel more “at home” there because the culture and diversity are pretty similar.

My goal coming out of law school was to continue to live like a student, which I think I've done a good job with.  My living expenses in 2020 were probably $20k or less.  Every extra dime that I didn't slowly set aside for savings went to loans.

The interest waiver on federal loans has been a godsend.  I most definitely would not have made this much progress without it.

Relevant income details:

Income last year: $65k

Income this year: $70k base plus bonuses

Monthly housing cost: mortgage is ~$1200 which I split with my wife in a mid-size city.

No kids.

Transportation: ~$200 a month for my car, $60 for insurance, and basically nothing on gas due to working from home.

Other income: I got the full amounts of the COVID relief checks.  Got married way cheaper than expected because of cutting down our guest list to only family and wedding party because of the pandemic, but people still sent us generous gifts which was a huge boost to savings.  Also had an unexpected windfall of about $5,000 last year.

I contribute 6% of my salary to my 401k for the employer match and maintain $10,000 in savings, a goal which I just recently reached.

Relatively low cost of living city, and I'm very frugal with student loans in mind at all times.

My goal from here is to pay $2,000 a month until the end of the interest waiver to get the balance down to about $146k, which is stretching my budget pretty thin but is definitely worth it to me.  Once the waiver ends, I'm planning to refi most of my loans to private over 15 years to give myself some wiggle room in my budget, drop my interest to hopefully around 3.7%.  The goal is to have a manageable payment so that we can afford to have kids, go on vacation, save a bit more more for retirement, etc.  Thinking that I will leave $40k federal just in case some level of forgiveness ends up happening.

Really excited to be making so much progress, and to have my highest interest loan paid off!",17,196,StudentLoans,2682

According to the Repayment Estimator, new IBR and PAYE are pretty similar. I'd pay  I'd pay \~$56K over 240 months with a payment of $183-274 and would have $415,000 forgiven and have a horrendous tax bomb.

The differences that I can see: I'd have to consolidate to enroll in PAYE, IBR is easier to qualify for, IBR no cap on unpaid interest vs PAYE which has a cap on unpaid interest.

**My questions:**

1. Does it matter which repayment plan I choose? Are there certain differences in how interest is treated?

Current lender: 3.95% for a 10 year with $60k, ELFI (nothing but great things to say), No co-signer. They actually gave me a lower rate to do the 10 year vs the 5 year. 

Current Payment: I'm paying $1.2k a month towards it, 2x minimum, my current payoff date would actually be about 5 years. I'm comfortable paying this and will probably bump it in the next 2 months to $1.5k a month, but would like to stay at $1.2k if possible.

Because the Parent Plus loan is under my father's name (and he hasn't made a single payment since signing on for them), he would be able to claim my payments for a tax write-off.

&#x200B;

AES (American Educational Services) services my loan for SunTrust, the holder of the loan. (Neither of which I had any choice in)

Both of my loans are federal loans, as confirmed by AES.

AES claims that it doesn't know anything and it's up to my bank, SunTrust, to decide whether it continues charging interest or extends the forbearance.

Last year, I had to call in order to get my loan forbearance extended to this year. Meanwhile, they are still charging interest. This month I called to ask why the loan forbearance wasn't automatically extended to September 2021 and was told by AES that they don't know anything about that, and the best they could do was give me another month.

What is going on here? Does an executive order from the president carry the force of law, or is just a strong suggestion to the banks handling student loans? How can AES not know anything about an executive order which directly affects them and everything they do.

Any help here is appreciated.

mm1lpc,Just paid off my private loan of $28322!,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Just wanted to share that I finished paying off my private loan of $28322 since the start of the Pandemic last year. Want to mention up front that my apartment least ended in June 2020 and I had the option to move back with family so that I could aggressively pay off this loan, about $2000 per month. I also threw what would have been my last month of rent in May 2020 since had already paid it, my security deposit, and every stimulus check that I received ($3200). Was definitely a difficult decision to move back with parents but now that I'm at the end I'm happy I did it and thankful I had the option.

For reference, 28 y/o male with a bachelors degree, Salary: $54500 and after taxes/benefit deductions I earn about $2900/month. I usually put $400 in my biweekly paycheck into my checking and put everything else into my reserve account until I'm ready to make a payment. 

&#x200B;

At the start of the pandemic I was sitting around $100,000 in loans just from my undergrad, and now am looking at little under $70,000. By September, I plan to have my remaining loans around $55,000 which are all federal at this point. By September I should be able to refinance one of my loans to a private where the payments are only about $60/month if I push it out to 20 years, which I am more than happy to do as it earns me more financial freedom. The last loan is on income base repayment so I'll handle that when the time comes. I got a different job where my salary increased between the lat time I filed for IBR so no idea what my monthly payment will be at this point. 

Praying for some student loan relief via government but I'm thankful I've been able to start handling the problem on my own. I wish everyone the best in their efforts to pay down their debt and hope you see relief from it soon.",55,315,StudentLoans,1825

I know I need to pivot and change industries as I'll never be able to make enough to afford them. The loans I'm talking about are all private I have about another 30k in federal loans but those, luckily I haven't had to start paying yet and once I do they will just end up defaulting as it's impossible to afford new bills. I'll never be able to afford a new car, a house, or a family. It seems like I've thrown away life based off a decision I made when I was young, dumb, and 18.

I’m currently making payments on my loans while they’re in the 0% period and I’m not quite sure how exactly each billing option will effect my payments after the interest kicks in again. 

Here is what the say for options: 

“You made a payment that is equal to or more than the amount of future monthly payments – do you want to be billed for your full Monthly Payment Amount? (Note: We’ll always apply your Overpayment toward your Current Balance.)

The Billing Direction assumes that payments you have scheduled are going to post to your account.

Billing Direction
•No, Advance my due date by the number of payments I cover. Even if you have zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total cost of borrowing.

•Yes, Bill me for my full monthly payment. You will be required to make a full monthly payment with your next billing statement.”
 
Does it really matter which one I choose? My understanding is that the advance due date only a little better because then I wouldn’t necessarily have a payment due but the interest will still accrue so I really should be making payments anyway, right?

Due to circumstances beyond my control my AGI for 2020 was $58,000 and thus I most likely will not be able to remain at $0 payment after this year's IBR is renewed.  

I was wondering what the term (loan repayment time) would be if I simply allowed IBR to expire and went back to the ""standard repayment"" plan.  I read that the term is usually ten (10) years, but wouldn't that have run in 2015?  These loans are from 2001-2005.  Or does that time I spent in forbearance, IBR, etc. toll the repayment time?  Or does that ten years start from the day I go back on standard repayment?  If I stayed in IBR with an AGI of $58,000 would the term remain at twenty-five years?  I'm totally lost.

EDIT: I remember from the paperwork I received in 2005 that my original term was for thirty (30) years.  Could this be true?  If so, does this mean it's been thirty years this whole time, through all the non-payment, forbearance, hardships, IBR, etc.?

I did find this, https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/standard  plus I just checked online and I do have an FFEL Direct Consolidation loan.  Disbursal Date 7/2005, Estimated Payoff Date 10/2032.  So I guess all this time of not paying anything and the thirty years just kept on ticking by?

It looks pretty legit.  So if I had a ten year original term, then the time would have run out already and I would have defaulted in 2015?",4,1,StudentLoans,1655
mkatmp,Pay down Student Loans while deferred (until9/31) or invest extra money now until loans need payment,"I have about 20,000 in student loans and the normal monthly payment BC (before Corona) was about $300/month.  I now havent paid any on them for a few months and been enjoying the extra cash to invest into the market and continue to build my dividend portfolio. My question is, due I continue using my ""student loan money"" each month to build portfolio (which should earn more percent each year than my 3-4% loans) or do I pay down on the loans as much as possible now while its basically free and I dont have to fight the small interest payments?

mk8ga6,Finally did it! Paid off my Student Loans Before Its Grace Period Ended!!,"Hi friends of Reddit,

I just wanted to hop on here and say I frickin' did it!! I paid off ALL my student loans (of \~$20k) within the grace period. 

I was so deadset on not paying interest on the loan, and was able to pay it all off with 10 days to spare before interest would start accruing. I worked extra shifts on the weekend, sold items of mine that I didn't need and was happy to pass along (not much $ but it helped), etc. I will say - shoutout to staying/living at home though - saved me loads of $$.

mk7l7g,Should I do it?,"I really want to go to nursing school. Have been interested in it since high school and I’m now almost 31. I live somewhere where I’ll have my schooling paid for for free, as a perk of having grown up here. I’ll also get $850/month for living allowance that’s forgivable  if I stay here after I graduate.

My issue is the cost of living. The reason the school benefits are good (ie: forgivable) is because it is extremely expensive to live here and not many people want to live here or stay . 

Our total for monthly bills (mortgage, heat, power, water, internet) is roughly $3000 a month. We also have to eat, so there’s that. My husband makes decent money but not enough for us to live comfortably. I’d have to take on a line of credit to afford to live. I DO have 6 months worth of expenses saved up but I will not, under any circumstances, touch that money. It’s for emergencies only. 

So....given my situation (my school is paid for), but having to take on debt to live while I’m in school...would you do it? Being in debt gives me anxiety but I really want to be a nurse.",13,3,StudentLoans,1078

i have $12k left on my car and right now i have enough to pay it off, leaving me with $2k. i also have $16k of student loans. obviously i dont plan of paying off my car now because i want to have at least $5k saved up for emergencies. 

Having debt drives me crazy!!! especially since i also want to save up for a house!! im in my late 20s. i want to buy a house by the time i hit my 30s. everyone around me keeps implanting doubt in my head about using all my money to pay off debt because i am already ""well off"" and i dont need to hurry to pay that off. i make $49k a year and i know i will be able to pay off my students loans within a year or 2. 

I think their worries is because they say im not taking care of myself, meaning that i havent bought new clothes. I am still wearing the same clothes, some clothes look a bit washed up. i only work and go home, some days ill meet up with friends/family or go to do outdoor activities. they also worry because im doing so much OT and they think i dont need all that OT, and are scared that i might crash and end up in the hospital. what they dont understand is that i love my job, therefore doing OT doesnt exhaust me. my job is not physically nor mentally draining, so doing OT is nothing! i dont care about buying new clothes because thanks to this pandemic, i cant go out to fancy places so whats the use? ( for now at least) 

i am a humble person..... i never care about fancy things. i spoiled myself with having food on the table and a roof over my head. once im debt free, i will gladly spoiled myself with new clothes. i would love to take vacations but having debt has made me ""frugal"". am i wrong? i dont think im wrong but constantly hearing the opposite is making me question my ways.",13,2,StudentLoans,1892

mj0i7g,Experience with lawyer loan negotiations,"Hey, I have Navient student loans (all private unfortunately so im not sure how much biden's plans will help me) They are about 93k as of today (Some federal loans have been paid off.) Unfortunately, I have had a difficult time finding a worthwhile job after college, and now on disability. My dad has been helping with the bills but Navient keeps increasing our payments beyond what we (specifically he) can afford. We have paid over 100k with approx $500 or more a month for the last 12 years, yet my current balance is 14k more than what it started. I guess its all going to interest, but we can't even afford that. Because he is a cosigner, I'm not sure if i can get the disability relief, though I'm going to try.   


But it is impossible for us to get ahead with this. and since they keep increasing our rates, the difference between what he can pay and what they want ends up collecting more and more fees, and we get harassed constantly, and of course it affects our otherwise good credit, thus reducing our ability to refinance.   


I talked to a lawyer, and of course he can't make any guarantee as to the amount they can reduce, though said they've gotten total payment down up to 50% for some people, but that was with a lump sum payback offer. They'd charge me $6k with no guarantee of how much they could get for me. Even a set figure (pay back X more) and that's it, would be better then this interest based system with no end in sight.  If they could drop our total payback by that $6k or more, and come up with a better payment plan to something we could better afford, it'd be a no brainer to go with them, but not knowing for sure, or even a ball park what they can do, its a hard number to risk when we have little income to waste.

More Klain on student debt: Biden will ""look at that legal authority"" in said memo, ""he’ll look at policy issues around that, and then he’ll make a decision.""

mhvnrh,Trying to get tips on my situation,"As it currently stand I will be graduating with around $17,000 of debt out of college next year. I have 4 Loans and they are are follows:

Back at my old job I loved playing pranks - especially on my CEO.  There was the year I put 1500 rubber ducks in his office, or the year I got a local colleges marching band to play Hail to the Chief when he walked in, or when I put signs on all the printers stating they were now all voice activated.  Good times.

Well now i work from home and the cat is harder and less satisfying to prank so I'm taking a different approach.

I'm launching, along with more than 30 other organizations, a social media campaign to warn consumers about student loan scams.  The theme is #DontBeFooled

mhqub5,Why should I pay my student loan?,"With a $70K salary I'm supposed to raise kids, get a mortgage, car and be happy? The whole purpose of this loan was to actually increase my salary. If this failed - the loaner should be the one responsible, because they gave me the  money. They have the means to calculate if my degree will actually give me a good salary. Instead they are protected from default. Not fair. And just paying my student loan I'm actually losing money and not living at all.

On another hand, I can pay only the loan % and something small, say 25$ per month and aim for at least 100$ per month in savings. Now these savings I use to make money. Say, buy stocks (like the ARK ETF for example).

1) my student loan is at 5.3% and if I make even 5.4% at least per year using these savings, I'm actually making money, not losing.

2) my student loan on my credit score - is used to calculate my whole debt. The more debt I have and with regular payments, and monthly minimum payment - this will actually increase my credit score and will allow me to take more loans and use them to make more money.

Even if I take lots of loans, if I manage to pay the required minimum payment and I'm gaining even a 0.
1% more per year - I'm actually making money, not losing them. So my student loan is actually helping me get rich by giving me a credit score power.

What am I missing ?


==============
UPDATE:
regarding the question that ""they entrusted me the money and I refuse to pay?"" - I agree, this is probably a correct question and a tough one. But allow me please to refraim this question so that it falls more in line with the real situation.

A group of experts in money management, risk management and human resources with a bunch of automated algorithms and programs to assess my request and a database of thousands of demands like mine, received my request to take their money in exchange for a certain percentage in order for me to buy a college degree. They are experts in calculating the risks, assessing the probability of my salary, know the current mortage and spending levels, are aware about market risks, annual inflation, have algorithms to assess my human psychology and consequently to calculate the probability that I will have a job based on the degree that I receive. Nevertheless, these people have 0 (zero) risk with their money since their money are backed by the state. On the other hand, I risk several years of my life, believing that a degree will increase my salary.

Compounded by the fact that now I received the money and I'm already biased on spending them on a college degree, I am searching for a degree based on some of my own priorities like some BS story of - ""I want to do something that I love doing"". The college is well aware about what degree they are selling, they know the probability of me having a good job, they know about the loan, they know that I'm biased to buy what they are selling me, and yet they have absolutely no obligation regarding the quality of that degree.

Basically, a group of experts in education sold me a stock that is worth nothing (the so-called degree) - worth nothing because the market pays nothing for it (officially called salary), these experts (the college) have no obligation whatsoever regarding their stock (the degree), the college takes the money from another group of experts (the loaning company), to pay the fake stock (the degree), and now the governemnt obliges me to do anything that I can just to repay those money that were used for buying a fake stock using a salary that is not in line with today's market conditions and a salary that is diminishing every year due to inflation while the loan percentage stays the same ?

HM ..... the game is rigged. How about we change the rules: say they loan me money, but if I don't get the required salary - I have no obligation to pay them back. This small change automatically brings a risk level to the loaning company, doesn't it ? With this new risk - will they still give me that loan ? I don't think so. Without the loan, the college will not sell a fake degree. If there is no demand for a degree, the college will be obliged to change the degrees they are selling. And THAT my friend - is the true ""demand - based"" market.

Now - ask me again your question - do I want to pay my student loan ? :) NO, I don't. The truth is that I was deceived. Two groups of experts sold me a fake stock (a degree), that is worth nothing, and just took advantage of the fact that I didn't know what I am buying. Thank you Daniel Kahnehman, Robert Cialdini and Dan Ariely for opening my eyes about psychological manipulation. I am the victim here and I have no obligation to pay their loan. I did my part - I studied hard, and got the degree. On the other hand - the college, the loaning company and the government - deceived me. Of course I will pay that student loan because today the Governement is protecting the con-man. But I will pay it on my terms, say in 50 years, (provided there are no changes in percentage).",15,0,StudentLoans,5017

I am married, husband has salary paying job at $80k.

I have 200k in FedLoans with 20k outstanding interest in limbo w/ COVID. I never consolidated. There are around 14 loans with interest rates ranging from 5-8% when active.

My husband has 250k in student debt: 60% federal and 40% private. Right now I'm trying to hustle down my own debt, but chiming in on the bigger picture of us as a whole is welcomed too.

We are early 30's, just bought our first house this year (1.6k a month mortgage), 70k in savings (plus our 401ks). No kids. We both come from low-income, struggling families and are completely self-made (hence the significant debt). I say this because I keep hoarding money in savings as a safety net. I need a financial planner (I know this) but I get very anxious to avoid living paycheck to paycheck, which is why the 70k hasn't been applied towards loans. 

So with all that being said, my main question is: given that I'm commission (i.e. not a stable salary) do I refinance my loans and consolidate for a lower interest rate? Should I just hustle down my debt with the government and have the safety net if I cannot make payments? Should I stop putting so much in savings and start throwing it at the loans?

I'm currently a freshman at a community college transferring next year to a state school where before aid the average cost is $28,269 and after aid for a household income under 30k is around $12,000. I currently have $3,500 subsidized loans and $2,000 in unsubsidized loans (I get the most financial aid possible from FAFSA, including the $6,345 Pell Grant). After the 6 month grace period after my PhD program, the interest will be 2.75% for both. Once I graduate undergrad, I will have $16,500 in federal loans.

Next year, considering there will be no change in my low-income household financially, I'm assuming this aid will continue next year. This means, if the statistics are fairly accurate, there will be around $24,000 left for my cost of attendance. I don't have a co-signer since my mother does not help me financially.

Where should I take out loans if I can't afford school?

Can I take out a loan with a student credit card (I have Chase Freedom Student)?

Has anyone appealed their financial aid decision to get more money?

Should I look into the Parent Plus Loan if I can convince my mother (I would be paying it back)? The interest rate would be 5.30% after I graduate.

Should I start repaying the unsubsidized loans during my PhD program before there is interest?

mgkibw,Huge announcement from the ED regarding defaulted FFEL loans/COVID,"The ED just announced they are extending the covid waivers to defaulted commercially held FFEL.  This means zero percent interest backdated to March 13th, all involuntary payments refunded and voluntary payments having the option of being refunded.

It also means anyone who defaulted on a commercial FFEL (which is most FFEL) after March 13th will have their loan placed back in good standing.  Hypothetically, once the loan is back in good standing you would no longer get the zero percent interest but see my comment below.

If you were pursuing rehab and missed a rehab payment during the covid period, that month would still count for rehab (which matters to those who defaulted prior to March 13th)

here's the presser https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USED/bulletins/2ca3aaa

there will be more info on thursday 

Now - to address the elephant in the room - for those borrowers of FFEL in good standing - there was no discussion of also extending the waivers to them - however they did hint that they are working on something.  So if you have the bright idea to default to get the zero percent interest don't do it - one - you don't have enough time to default before the waivers end and two - they MAY be working to extend this further so just sit tight and keep your fingers crossed.",48,112,StudentLoans,1299

mg4bex,"UPDATE: Debt from a cosigned loan, other I didn't cosign","A quickie, I made a post in Feb about a loan (well there are two now) that one I cosigned but the other I did not.  The advice was to dispute and send them a form from the debt rights site, which I did.  These guys are called MRS BPO in NJ.  I sent them a three page dispute asking for validity, proof of payments, statute of limitations, and the right to even collect a debt from another state.

Well they responded, came in the mail today, and I'm a bit pissed.

1. One of the things I asked for was proof of transactions and by whom.  Apparently they gave me a sheet of ""transactions"" from 06 all the way to last month!  Yet they did not disclose WHO made the payments, or where they came from or if these are ""fees"" tacked up.  My in law who I cosigned one of the loans for has no clue was was giving me one sentence answers.  His wages were garnished and I wonder if this was the garnishment or them making up fees to make it look like payments?  There's no paper trail, just their ""proof"".
2. No promissory note.  This is a big one, instead it's a scan of the check the bank sent over front and back, one of them has my sisters signature along with my in law and what was supposed to pass off as mine.  AFAIK without the prom note they can't collect.  The application was also missing from what I requested.  I also asked them to identify the primary signer, they did not do that either.
3. Lack of settlement, while I did not admit that the debt is mine I did request a settlement in case, they did not include one.
4. They did not explain the added fees or interest, or specify the last billing statement.
5. They also did not answer if they are licensed to collect from my state since they are based in NJ.

I'm also mad that I can't get my in law to even check what was all in his garnishments, he doesn't care.  They were living in their truck for years while the garnishments were active.  My sister is a dullard who's a stay at home wife who can't keep a story straight so I can't rely on her either.

I did call a lawyer up and he kept bringing the statute of limitations up.  Thing is, that sheet of the dates and random amounts, I don't know if they were payments or the agencies tacking on random fees to balloon the amount?  They did not disclose anything.

So now I have to make yet another letter, disputing that they do not have all the information I've asked for and that unless they do everything I've asked for to the last request, they have no means to collect from me.  I may even ask for my brother in law's contact info as proof since even I don't have that info in case something were to happen to my sister in an emergency.

I also just checked my credit report, not a trace of them even looking into me.",4,3,StudentLoans,2734

I’ve already been though this shit with my parents when I was first applying for undergrad, and I was telling my parents we need to fill it out and their response was “no, we make too much money and you won’t have get anything, so I don’t want to waste my time” which yes they do make a comfortable salary, but I feel like even if I filled it out I’d at least get a mf $1 from the FASFA....anyways now we back in this same situation and same answer from them.....I did get merit based scholarships but I feel like I could bring my cost down a bit if they would just help me fill it out. (I know it won’t be a lot bc I didn’t apply in October). So anyways, I’m not sure how to approach it because they want me to get a lot of scholarship money and even to me not to claim them as a dependent so I can get more money, and I’ve argued with them several times explaining it doesn’t work like that and I have to be 24.....I’m not sure if it’s because my parents are immigrants so they don’t really understand how the US educational system works, or is because they are mad from when my older brother applied and apparently “he didn’t get anything”.

The issue i'm having is that my loans were previously consolidated as part of a part of a Direct Lending Program that's no longer around (FFEL), which means they aren't eligible for consolidation under the current programs unless I take on additional student loan debt. Once i do, my understanding is I will be eligible to consolidate them and bring my interest rate down since it's an average of the new loan and the rates I already have. 

My question is regarding the new debt.  I make decent money, but way too much of it is going to student loan payments yet I'm making no headway. The last thing i need is more SL debt, but if that's the only workaround, then so be it.  What programs are out there that are relatively low cost that might qualify? Are there certificate programs that would be beneficial to me? Management or Leadership programs for example that i can use student loans to finance the cost?  Has anyone done this before?

Here's how we did it. When my wife and I got married in July 2019, we had $80K in debt and an interest rate of 6.74%. With that interest rate, our minimum monthly payment was barely shaving off a few dollars from the loan principle. We compared rates with dozens of companies, and decided to go with Earnest, who offered us a rate of 3.45%, almost half the rate we were paying before. With our new interest rate, our minimum payment dropped dramatically and we were saving $400/month in interest payments alone. We took the savings and any extra money we could earn and began to aggressively pay off our debt. We stayed committed to our goal, and 21 months later, we are debt free!

&#x200B;

Edit: apparently I should clarify that I have no connection to Earnest. I just recommend them because they offered us the best rates and they never gave me a problem. If another company gives you better rates, go with them.

meakxg,Question about investing money for loans before paying,"So I was making some small payments to my student loans ($72k) during this forbearance period we're all on and when I move to a new apartment in June, start paying more than the minimum of m loans (I'm on IBR so it's around $400 and I was going to shoot for $500 a month). I saw some people suggest holding onto the money for those few months and investing it, which seems like a smart idea. I have a small investment account and for the month it's already made more than $100. 

&#x200B;

My idea is to take $4000 I should have saved up by the end of September, take $2000 of that to knock out the unpaid interest of my loan with the highest interest rate. Then just leave the other $2000 in that account and let the gains keep coming in. Then before the year is up, I take all of the gains, let's say it's a few hundred, and throw that into the loan as an extra payment, and just keep repeating it. 

Or should I try to build up $5k, which would be just about the accrued interest for all my loans, knock that out completely, and pay the $500 a month which should be enough to cover the interest both loan accrue during a month (I calculated it's about $300) and the extra would go toward the principal to ideally to the loan with the higher interest rate first.",4,0,StudentLoans,1264

I am wondering how to tackle my student loans + buy a house next year. Here's the backstory - I have about $25k federal student loans currently frozen by the gov. I paid off all my CC debt (about $17k) over the past year, plus I paid off my car, and I have savings  for a home. I live in a relatively low-cost of living area but still think the home prices are overinflated. Waiting for prices to cool off. I can wait it out. 

I hope to get a mortgage in the next year-ish. Should I pay off my student loans, or let them sit on my credit? Current credit score is 806 Excellent. I was going to start debt snowballing my loans like I did for my consumer debt, but that would close the accounts and possibly cause my credit score to go down. Instead I'm saving in a 'high yield' account to make a lump-sum payment in September when the freeze ends. 

**I WANT to see my student loan balance go down (and for the peace of mind), but I don't want to lose my 806 credit score because I hope to get a mortgage within the next 18 months. Anybody ever been in a situation like this? Should I buy the house, and then pay off the loans in a lump-sum?** I am going to continue sending money to a savings account until the freeze is up so I do have time to decide what I wanna do.

* salary: \~$70k
* age: 20 somethin' 
* debt: public student loans of $25k
* credit score: 806
* no cc debt, no car debt (available credit is $36k)
* hoping to buy a home for \~$250k with my partner (excellent credit / no debt) and put a combined 20%ish down

mdts0e,Student loans half paid off- a long journey!,"Hi all! 31F. 

Love reading your advice on here, I wish I had known about this earlier as a first generation college student. I had no financial help during college and really had to figure out the loan process as a pretty naive, but hardworking 20 year old. (I paid for 2 years of community college out of pocket). My mom always said “get a degree so you don’t struggle like your dad and I have”. But navigating this wasn’t easy without any guidance from anyone. 

 I finished grad school in 2015 with 40k in fed loans (17k from undergrad, 23k from grad school). I worked full-time throughout all of college, so paid as much as I could out of pocket- super stressful, but worth it. I didn’t make much, but enough to pay for my living expenses (split with my husband) and books. 

After graduation, I pretty much just paid the interest each month with the IBR- but the last 2.5 years I got really serious about paying down my debt with a slight increase in salary. My loans are NOW at 20k. I know I have still a ways to go, but since these loans have literally been haunting me since Dec 2011 (when I finished undergrad), I’m just so grateful to have made it this far.

Keep chugging along! Nothing feels as good as watching that number drop every month. I have a 9 month old son and I NEVER want him to go through the stress of student loans. I am proud of my education, but the “typical American student loan process” is such a mess. Worth it? I guess so because I’m FINALLY working at a job I love.

Now just imagine you continue to make roughly 60,000-70,000 a year for 10 years. Awesome. You're able to get whatever reminder after 10 years forgiven

Here's the catch...if you have a job that increases your salary every year, imagine making 80-100k within 5 years (police officers and firefighters have these increases) now your student loan monthly payment under your income repayment plan since it generates from your W2 you will be paying about $650 a month for the next 5 years after

When you calculate all this, did you really forgive anything? No because by year 8 you would've finished everything, and you paid way more than your standard. If your standard loan was about $520 a month then you're better off just doing that for 10 years.

So in reality PSLF didn't forgive shit. You just paid more.

>The grand total: $70.3 billion.  
>  
>To be specific, that’s how much the government collected on its loan portfolio in financial year 2019, the last full year before payments were paused due to the pandemic. It covers only payments on loans that are owned and managed by the government, which currently total about $1.4 trillion, according to the Department of Education’s latest portfolio summary. It doesn’t count payments on the $160 billion worth of outstanding loans that are government backed but owned by private lenders, which were made under the old federal student loan program that was discontinued after 2010. Nor does it cover private debt.

Why in the heck is there a government ""profit\*"" motive attached to educating its citizens?  The benefit to a society from having an educated populous is in ***having an educated populous***.

I finished undergrad and went onto grad school, that was paid for with Federal student loans (4-6% interest), for which I did not require a cosigner. I was employed full-time throughout both my undergrad and graduate years, but due to being out on my own and funding all my own expenses, I don't have much in savings -- maybe 8 grand. 

I finished my MBA last year and the roughly 10k in federal loans I have are delayed to September (thanks 'Rona.) Sallie came to collect my private ones (for which I now owe nearly $188k in debt) this month. After telling them I was unable to make a $2150/mo payment to keep my account current, I called them to see what my options are. They told me they best they could offer me was 12 months of interest-only payments, which totalled $1600 a month. I cannot sustain that. 

I have been looking for weeks at refinancing my private loans, and after getting rejected (even with a cosigner) from almost all of them, I was approved for a refi at a rate of 4.9% and a monthly payment of $1250 -- which is better, but still wildly uncomfortable for me. I have yet to sign the loan offer. I reached out to them asking if there was any way we could renegotiate to get me a lower monthly payment, but I feel sick to my stomach and have been in and out of anxiety attacks for days now because I literally do not know what to do. 

FWIW, I have a credit score of 707, take home \~3650 a month. After living expenses (rent, utilities, internet, car payment) I'm left with $1531. If I take this refi option, which feels like the *only* option for me at this point, I'll be left with just about $280 per month. I don't even know what I'll do when my federal loan payments kick in. 

I'm already going to try to get a roommate to cut down on expenses, but I'm locked into my housing situation for the forseeable future. I don't want to do this to myself -- but I don't know what else to do. I feel so sick and stupid and helpless.

EDIT: 
hi sorry for the vagueness. Including more detail here. 
Yes I did recently finish my MBA, and I am employed with a company I’ve been with for the last two years. I recently got a promotion (literally this month) which took my income from $60k to $65k, so I likely won’t be up for a raise until at least end of the year. 

I have 30 days to accept my refinance offer and intend to do so, however the final offer from Earnest was $1275 a month at 5.08%, not the original 1250 @ 4.9%, but it’s still my best option. 

With that said, my expenses breakdown like so: 
My monthly take home after taxes &amp; benefits: $3712 
Less rent: 1650 
Less car payment: 170 
Less Car insurance: 85
Less savings auto transfer: 100
Less internet: 45
Less water/utilities/trash: 150 
Less student refinance pmt: 1275
Total cash after expenses: $237

mcdk2t,Financing second degree in nursing,"  

I’m trying to find a way to finance an accelerated second bachelor’s degree in nursing. I currently have no debt, a credit score of 796 (I’ve paid off my credit cards in full every month for twelve years), $15k saved in my checking account, and a house that I own free and clear and that PNC Bank assessed as being worth $130k (Frankly I don’t think I could get that much for it, but maybe the appraiser knows more than me. I bought it for $55k in a rough neighborhood that has changed a lot in the last decade). If it’s relevant, my overall GPA is 3.9 and my math and science GPA is 4.0. The tuition for the program that accepted me is 55k. The school offers no financial aid and FAFSA is only offering $12.5k in loans.  

I really thought I was in good shape for getting a loan, but I’ve been rejected by both College Ave (for a student loan) and PNC Bank (where I tried to get a home equity loan). Both stated that my income level is too low as the sole reason for rejection. This is frustrating, because clearly the point of returning to school for a career-focused degree is to increase income and I’ve demonstrated clearly that I’m responsible to a fault. In the last two years I’ve been employed full time as an intern at a cancer research facility ($8/hr) and then as an EMT ($16/hr) while attending school part-time to fulfill the nursing prerequisites.

mc9vbu,StudentLoans v/s using Home Equity for college,"Hello,

Our kid will be starting college this year. 

Given our current earnings, we don't qualify for any assistance and will have to end up paying \~80K/year for college. Yes, we are aware of cheaper in-state alternatives and this is their preferred college/program and we fully support their decision.

Hopefully by the second year, internships or TA, may help pay for some of the housing and misc expenses.

We have  $30K in a 529 plan, along with $10k in savings account. 

Most of our savings being wiped out due to long term care expenses for immediate family over the last few years, who recently passed away from COVID exposure, so there are no new expenses on that front. 

We have been living lean for the last few years, trying to limit our expenses. Have a savings of \~$500/month based on our current living expenses which we currently use to pay extra towards our home equity line of credit, which we can expand a bit, by cutting down on other expenses like TV and getting rid of the second car which could get our monthly savings \~$800/month. 

My plan was to use the 529 plan & use our savings and pay for the first semester.

We also plan on requesting the college to reconsider their decision based on our financial situation, but are not too hopeful

Do have equity in our home that we can borrow against (\~$120K) for under 3%. This should help pay for \~2 years of college. 

Should we still apply for Federal & Plus loans or use the equity in our home as a first resort ? What makes sense in the long term ?

mc8xjr,On track to get my loans below $100k by 2022!,"$100k is still a lot, but I started off with almost $170k after graduating in 2016 between my mom's parent plus loans and my federal and private loans. For the first couple of years after graduating, I was basically just paying the interest, but my salary increased each year and I was able to aggressively pay towards the principal in the last three or so years.

I got rid of my private loan at the beginning of quarantine, so now I just have federal loans. I currently have $12k\~ in my name and $109k\~ in my mom's name. I've been lucky to earn enough, stay employed throughout Covid, and save due to the loans being deferred. Just this past week I put $17k towards my loans and I'm feeling great.

mc5zuh,Teacher Forgivness denied again - advice needed.,"TLDR: 5000.00 teacher forgiveness loan is being denied due to “outstanding loan taken before 10/31/1998”. I started my undergrad in 1998. 

Background: I started undergrad in 1998. I had moved out of my parents house and was living on my own. My parents provided no financial assistance to me for college so I took out loans and worked part time to be able to attend and pay for living arrangements. My husband and I were dating at the time and he did the same. We graduated in Dec of 2001 which was terrible timing as we had a difficult time landing jobs. Finally he found employment in another state and we moved. 
We consolidated our loans into 1 to make the payments easier to handle (stupid in hindsight but we had no one to ask advice of as my parents had their schooling paid for and his didn’t attend college). 

We both worked from 2002-2008 in our respective professions, paying on the loan as per the agreement. In 2008 after the birth of our 2nd child I lost my job with a national homebuilder and couldn’t find another (go figure). Our income was cut in half. He had gone back to school for an MBA and I decided to go for a career change since it didn’t look like my industry would come back anytime soon. We had 2 full time jobs (I was hired earlier than expected due to a willingness to teach in a title 1 school, already having a degree and working on a master’s), 2 small children, and we were both back in school. We knew the debt from SL was getting up there but we only took out what we absolutely had to. 

We both graduated and had been paying it back since then. I worked as a teacher for 5 1/2 years in title one schools, enjoyed it but am no longer a teacher. We did not consolidate our graduate loans. He is working on PLFP and I was eligible for the 5000.00 TLF. I filled out the application and submitted it and they sent me a note saying because I had an outstanding loan before Oct 1998 I was not eligible for TLF on my graduate school direct loans. (Remember I started in Sept of 1998). I called and spoke to them arguing that I had barely started school at that time and was told “only the secretary of education could change the date”. Denied because of an “Outstanding” loan. We have been paying on undergrad since 2002 but b/c it’s consolidated we don’t qualify for any type of assistance other than pausing it during 2008 and 2009 while we tried to get back on our feet. We are doing fine now so we decided to get a personal loan in his name to pay it off (better interest rate anyway) so I would be eligible for the TLF. At this point I had paid so much in interest that the “forgiveness would really only cover the compounded interest not principle. 

We did that in January so the old loan to the government is “paid”. I resubmitted my application a few days ago and last night received the denial letter for the same reason. If you read this far (thank you). I’m so frustrated and don’t know what to do from here. I guess because I took out a loan at all for undergrad I’m denied this simple TLF.
I earned it, fulfilled all the requirements and frankly have paid far more in interest payments and have years before both will be paid off. We are also worried about my husband’s PLSP. He qualified and only has another year left. Advice would be appreciated.",7,3,StudentLoans,3296

mbz3db,Master's degree from Oxford worth the investment/student loans?,"Hello fellow redditors, 

Not sure if this is the right place to post, but would appreciate any and all perspectives -- here goes:

I've gotten an admission offer from Oxford for a 1-year MSc program in the social sciences (one of two programs I applied to, both at Oxford, still waiting to hear back for the other one). I'm super excited about it, almost certain that I am going to accept the offer as this one was my first choice - the only thing that is giving me some pause is knowing that I will have to take out around $40k in student loans to afford it, in addition to blowing a big chunk of my cash savings. 

The total cost of attendance including tuition would come out to $60-70k, depending on how frugally I go about the living costs. I won't know for another month or two whether I will have any scholarships from the university, but as an American I am not banking on getting any funding as it is crazy competitive for their master's programs and especially for non-EU or Commonwealth international students. I will also be spending some time in the coming months applying for any other scholarships I can find, but from what I have gleaned so far the opportunities are relatively scant/small dollar, especially for a master's degree abroad. I don't come from any kind of family money, so it pretty much will have to be self-funded.

My motivations for applying and wanting to do this program in the first place is a combination of (1) the academic/social/networking experience I would be getting from the opportunity to study in that prestigious environment for a year, (2) potential for future professional opportunities as a result of having the Oxford ""brand name"" on my resume (though I know this is somewhat more limited for a social sciences degree compared to something like an MBA/finance/engineering degree/etc.), (3) opportunity to live abroad for 1+ year, depending on whether I decide to/am able to find a job in the UK after completing the degree (honestly more for the adventure of it than anything else), and (4) burnout from my current job that pays decently well but that I have grown to kind of hate and generally a desire to step back from the working world for a while and potentially re-orient my career -- I honestly really enjoy school.

A bit of additional personal background/context:

* I graduated from a top 5 US university for undergrad + another humanities master's degree (both from the same university). I don't have any debt from either of those degrees since I come from a low-income background, so I qualified for full financial aid for undergrad and got full funding for the master's program through a combination of need-based and merit-based scholarships + part-time work. Also, already having a fancy degree, I know there is probably less of a potential boost from another fancy degree.
* In general, I don't have any other personal debt. I've been living back with my parents for the last 2.5 years since finishing school, no rent payments and no car payments or anything, so I've been able to save pretty aggressively.
* Have been working for 2 years and currently making a salary of $76k. After the degree, I would plan to pursue career opportunities where I would be making at least that much (my target is to find something in the $80k-$100k range in some kind of consulting or like higher-level government advising roles; I currently work in policy. Though obviously that is not guaranteed). 
* I plan to stay at my current job through June and would be leaving with about $40k in cash savings + \~$35k across Roth IRA/401k/taxable investment accounts + $9-10k across a few checking accounts. My plan would be to use around $30k of the cash savings to cover my living expenses for the year and take out federal student loans to pay for tuition. I'd like to still have some cash at the end of the program to have a cushion for the job search + any family emergencies that might come up (my parents are kind of broke and I always have an underlying worry of needing to step in to help them through financial rough patches). Ideally will not touch any of the investment accounts. 
* I'm not interested in/did not apply to any master's programs in the US (I feel like I've already had that experience + even if I would qualify for more financial aid domestically, tuition is quite a bit higher here so I think the cost would come out somewhat similar). 

I think I am partly seeking validation that I'm not absolutely nuts to be willing to take on that kind of debt (especially in this economy) for what amounts to an expensive escape from feeling trapped/stagnant/unhappy with where I am in life right now (compounded by pandemic burnout), but at the same time hoping that it will be a worthy investment in a big personal growth and learning experience. However, I welcome all perspectives/critiques, especially from any who may have completed master's degrees in the UK/Europe and whether you felt your experience was worth it if it is something that you had to self-fund. 

(And of course, all of this is assuming that COVID is more under control by the fall and there is a high likelihood that the program will be mostly or fully in-person; definitely not going to pay that kind of money for an online degree. We're able to withdraw from the program any time up to when it starts).",13,11,StudentLoans,5341

Loan type: direct federal loans
Amount: $100k
Interest: 6.8%
Monthly Est for standard payment: $1100
Monthly est for PAYE: $300

PAYE Payment: I am thinking about pursuing the PAYE plan which gives me not only a low monthly payment, but also allows me to jump on the PSLF plan if I can land a public job in the future. This option allows me to also make extra payments and pay off the entire loan so I don't have to wait 20 years for forgiveness if I don't go the PSLF route. 

My question is, if I decide to go with the standard 10 year payment plan, will I really be saving an exorbitant amount on interest considering that I'll be making extra payments every month to pay it off? Or would sticking to the PAYE plan be more beneficial even though it'll take longer and there's a tax bomb at the end?

I have disputed it but I don't know if it will do any good given it is accurate just an honest mistake. And I explained that to them when filing the dispute. I have been saving exactly for this loan and can pay it off in full (I could have before it went late i just wasn't aware, but that's my fault). Should I pay it off in full or pay excess payments to use it to build my credit back up.

how long might it take to get that score back to where it was?",2,3,StudentLoans,1139

Addendum:
I have now talked to Laurel Road and Earnest.

For Laurel Road the answer is yes.  If you want to maintain separate accounts, you can maintain separate accounts, you just have to specify that you do not want to consolidate in the contract before you sign the final documentation.  You will get one account number but individual ""series"" numbers for each of the loans and you can concentrate additional payments to one loan at a time.

For Earnest the answer is ""no, but.""  The only way to have separate loans is to refinance them one at a time, but if you make a large additional payment you can choose to either shorten the term of the loan  - OR - you can specify that you would like to maintain the length of the loan but reduce monthly payments.",4,1,StudentLoans,1045

Please forgive my ignorance here. I tried to do some searching on this sub (and r/personalfinance) but I didn't come up with a straight answer. I tried googling as well, but most of the posts are about lowering your payments, NOT about paying it off sooner.

Backstory:  I knew my fiancé had ""a lot"" of student debt, but we recently sat down and reviewed our finances and I was shocked to find that he has over $100K in student loans for his bachelor's degree. He's been paying on them for about 5 years already. About half of this is on a private loan through SoFi with a 20 year repayment. My questions focus around this loan.  


He has an offer to refinance and knock off a few percentage points. This makes sense to me, but after fooling around with the repayment tool, I realized that decreasing the repayment to 10 years only increases the payment by a few hundred dollars. That's totally doable with our combined income. However, cranking it down to a 5 year is only a few hundred more. Still doable.  
He brought up that we could refinance to a 10 year and just increase the payment by a few hundred extra and still pay it off in 5 years. This would protect us if we had an emergency (also, we plan to have kids in the next few years -- I'm older than him and waiting a few more years until his loans are paid down isn't a safe option  -- and we might regret committing to that higher payment when we're funding day care.   
Is there a downside to refinancing to a 10 year loan and paying at the 5 year rate?

I don't have student loans nor do I know a ton about debt. I have a car loan but I over pay on that, and I noticed that the overpayment just applies to the next payment, not to the principal, so I think that means I'm still paying the same amount of interest in the long run, just paying it early. I don't want to do the same thing on his loans.

mapuxf,US Dept. of ED streamlines Borrower Defense claim process," From [www.ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov) (see press releases)

Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced it will streamline debt relief determinations for borrowers with claims approved to date that their institution engaged in certain misconduct. The Department will be rescinding the formula for calculating partial relief and adopting a streamlined approach for granting full relief under the regulations to borrower defense claims approved to date. The Department anticipates this change will ultimately help approximately 72,000 borrowers receive $1 billion in loan cancellation.

“Borrowers deserve a simplified and fair path to relief when they have been harmed by their institution’s misconduct,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “A close review of these claims and the associated evidence showed these borrowers have been harmed and we will grant them a fresh start from their debt.”

Current provisions in federal law called ""borrower defense to repayment"" or ""borrower defense"" allow federal borrowers to seek cancellation of their William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans if their institution engaged in certain misconduct. Beginning today, the Department will ensure that borrowers with approved borrower defense claims to date will have a streamlined path to receiving full loan discharges. This includes borrowers with previously approved claims that received less than a full loan discharge.

Full relief under the regulations will include:

* 100 percent discharge of borrowers’ related federal student loans.
* Reimbursement of any amounts paid on the loans, where appropriate under the regulations.
* Requests to credit bureaus to remove any related negative credit reporting. And,
* Reinstatement of federal student aid eligibility, if applicable.",0,1,StudentLoans,1812

I'd be inclined to work on the ones that are normally highest interest, but right now they are at 0% due due to the pandemic. The others - all FFELP - are at a much lower rate; however, two of them are at variable interest rates. Do I work on reducing the balance of the current 0% ones so when we return to ""normal,"" they are less odious? Or do I work on the ones that are 2.43-3.25% and currently still accruing interest?

m9spod,Paid off the rest of my private student loan yesterday,"As title says I just finished paying off a private student loan that was originally $20,000. I was able to finish my first degree with very little debt but when I went back for a second degree (long story) I ended up really pilling the debt up. For those that might be unaware, the amount of public loans you qualify for when getting a second bachelor's degree decreases substantially and I implore everyone that if you really want a second bachelor's to try your best to get a double major before you graduate the first time.

Anyways, I still have a ways to go to clean up the public loan mess (about $35,000 right now), but paying off the private loan feels like a weight off my shoulders. Even though I should have been focusing on school at the time, the feeling of having so much debt gave me a lot of anxiety. In fact, I ended up not finishing and decided to just get a full time job which I ended up working myself into the job I was originally going back to school for (and now my employer is paying for me to finish).

The original loan was almost 10% interest so it almost might as well have been credit card debt. Thankfully after I got a job I refinanced and cut the rate in half, which did help in paying it off. Took about two years but those creditors will never get another penny from me and it feels pretty great.

Life lessons I would say to anyone who is considering going back for a second degree is you really need to do your homework about what kind of financial aid you will actually qualify for first. For example, because my second degree was pretty unrelated to my first degree, I didn't qualify for a dime of government loans until I had enough credits in the new program (CS). I probably should have done part time school and worked full time until I qualified for government assistance. While it's still student loan debt, it's lower interest and government loans are way more flexible for you life situation (income based repayments don't exist with private loans).

m9mqft,"Help, what do we do next?","My husband graduated from college in 1999.  He consolidated into FFELP loans in 2001(?) sometime before we married.  There are now two FFELP loans (owned by Deutsche Bank with NYS Higher Ed listed as the guarantor), totaling just under 17k.  He's been teaching in a Title 1 school for 20 years, not that that matters.  I have no student loans, and have delayed finishing my degree in part because taking on more student loans is not something we can do.  I work part-time (could have been full-time by now, but COVID happened, so somebody had to oversee the kids' schooling).  


Repeated medical bills, occasional poor decision-making, growing family, and large minimum payments have kept us in deferment or forbearance with intermittent periods of IBR for years.  We are finally at a place where we can actually pay on them but are now in a place where the minimum payment is too damn high.  We can maybe swing half of it if we push it, but we do not seem to be eligible for any sort of refinancing or reduced payment.  


What can we do?  While frustrated and annoyed, we're not opposed to paying them if we can keep the payments manageable.  We literally just refinanced the house last month (which is what freed up the money to pay on the student loans), and Earnest and the like require a higher credit score than my husband has. Navient is only providing us the option of graduated payments with a minimum of $505.  


Our oldest 3 kids are all headed to college within the next 5 years, and they will be starting at the CC because there's no help coming from mom and dad. :/",4,2,StudentLoans,1582

I am 24 years old almost 25 and I have the opportunity to live in the city Ive been wanting to live in (with a room mate of course) and although I feel like I should be ecstatic, I am wondering if it might be best for me to move in with my dad (who lives in a completely different state) and save up some money to pay off my debt. I am $25,000 in debt and I make 62,000/ year before taxes. I currently have about $9k in savings. If I moved out I would be paying $1200 rent including all possible utilities and about $200 on groceries every month. Bus pas would be about $55 a month so that makes all essential bills come out to about $1500/ month. My take home pay is about $3400 after taxes and 401k. (I contribute 8% and 6% gets matched). I also have about $20k in a ROTH IRA but I don’t know if I should touch this money and just pay off my student debt asap.

Anyways that brings me to about $1900 a month after all essential bills, I could technically just live like a hermit and just throw all the rest of my money at the loan but I don’t know what that would do for my mental health. If I stayed with my dad I would be very far away from my friends and boyfriend which could also affect my mental health. 

My job is not requiring anyone to come into the office  although we have the option to go in if we like. People from my team go in about 2 times a week but if I were to move I would be missing out on building in person relationships with them, or at-least putting that on hold for some time. I just started this job a month ago and its my first real job. If I wanted to save up to the amount that would pay all my student debt I would have to stay for about 7.5 months. 

These loans are federal if that matters. 

Also if I stayed with my dad I would have zero social life for the entirety of the 7 months. Missing out on spending my birthday with friends and essentially the entire summer.

I don’t know what to do and any advice would be helpful.

m8ohv7,Misleading Information on Forgiveness Plans (USA),"Recently, an article appeared on several news outlets lamenting how only 32 students received student loan forgiveness through income-driven repayment plans. Here’s a link to the article: https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/03/09/only-32-borrowers-have-ever-qualified-income-driven-repayment

Here’s the issue: Before 2009, the only income-driven repayment plan available was Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and ICR was only applicable to direct student loans, which comparatively few students qualified for at the time. ICR was implemented in 1994 or 1995 and is far less generous than newer income-driven repayment plans, like IBR, PAYE and REPAYE. 

ICR uses the one of these two criteria to determine monthly payments:

20% of your discretionary income divided by 12, with discretionary income for ICR purposes being defined as 100% of the federal poverty level

or

What you’d pay on a 12-year fixed repayment plan when adjusted for your income (I’m not sure what exactly this means or how the number is calculated)

The plan forgives any remaining balance after 25 years of qualifying payments. Therefore, being that ICR was implemented in the mid-1990s and charged a higher percentage of income for repayment purposes, I’m not at all surprised that so few people benefited from the forgiveness option, which would have only been available starting in 2019 or 2020. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that student loan balances drawn in the 90s were lower than today.

Over the next decade or so, student loan forgiveness per ICR, IBR, etc. will increase steadily as more people reach the time limit.",8,22,StudentLoans,1622

m8l8xn,Questions regarding a second bachelor degree seeking student who has never used loans,"Hi, all. I was wondering if anyone could provide some guidance as to how student loans work, especially for someone who has never touched loans. I graduated from college in 2018 with my BSN degree. Thankfully, with the amount of scholarships and grants that I was receiving, as well as living with my parents during my entire college career, I was able to pay things off debt free for my BSN. After a couple of years working as a nurse, I am considering going back to school and possibly getting a second bachelor's degree in clinical laboratory sciences. The school I was looking at, which is one of the very few in my state, offers a CLS program. The thing is, the price may require me to actually take out some student loans for the first time. 

My question(s) are as follows:

1) As a student who already holds a baccalaureate degree and who has received PELL Grant in the past, but never accepted any loans, would I still be eligible to receive student loans should I choose to seek a second baccalaureate degree?

2) When exactly should one apply for the FAFSA to determine eligibility for student loans? Would I have to wait til I am formally accepted into the program that I am applying for, or should I just do the FAFSA now, despite not waiting for an admission decision? 

3) Lastly, I know that some people have talked about loan forgiveness and not having to pay student loans right away. There is some sort of ""grace period"" or such. Would anyone care to please elaborate on this process and how this works?

m7tkzy,"ED Secretary Cardozo Repeals Awful ""partial relief"" rule put into place under Devos for borrowers defrauded by their schools","You guys - i am so happy!  The ED just issued a press release announcing the repeal of the draconian rule put into place under the last administration.  That rule created this pretty opaque partial discharge formula for borrowers whose borrower defense to repayment claims were approved.  I worked with many borrowers who received letters stating - congrats - we agree with you that your school defrauded you - based on our calculations - we've discharged 0% of your loans - yes - 0.  It was such an insult and just another example of the steps the prior administration went to to block relief for these defrauded borrowers.  

I'm pasting the text to the press release below - but if you were one of these borrowers my advice is to celebrate - but be patient.  There's tens of thousands of these borrowers and it will take a minute to sort this.  I don't expect you'll have to submit anything else - i do expect any refunds you might be owed to come from the servicer - but the servicer has no authority here so if it takes a few months - which it probably will - don't get blame them.  If you are an affected borrower i'd give it 90 days or so and if you don't hear anything reach out through the borrower defense portal.  If you are a borrower who has a pending claim - this announcement doesn't talk about those - but i would expect those to start moving finally as well - probably in the next six months or so - pure guess.

""Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced it will streamline debt relief determinations for borrowers with claims approved to date that their institution engaged in certain misconduct. The Department will be rescinding the formula for calculating partial relief and adopting a streamlined approach for granting full relief under the regulations to borrower defense claims approved to date. The Department anticipates this change will ultimately help approximately 72,000 borrowers receive $1 billion in loan cancellation.


“Borrowers deserve a simplified and fair path to relief when they have been harmed by their institution’s misconduct,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “A close review of these claims and the associated evidence showed these borrowers have been harmed and we will grant them a fresh start from their debt.”
Current provisions in federal law called ""borrower defense to repayment"" or ""borrower defense"" allow federal borrowers to seek cancellation of their William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans if their institution engaged in certain misconduct. Beginning today, the Department will ensure that borrowers with approved borrower defense claims to date will have a streamlined path to receiving full loan discharges. This includes borrowers with previously approved claims that received less than a full loan discharge.


Full relief under the regulations will include:
•	100 percent discharge of borrowers’ related federal student loans.
•	Reimbursement of any amounts paid on the loans, where appropriate under the regulations.
•	Requests to credit bureaus to remove any related negative credit reporting. And,
•	Reinstatement of federal student aid eligibility, if applicable.


This new approach replaces a methodology first announced in December 2019 to determine the amount of relief granted to borrowers with approved claims. After completing a comprehensive review of that methodology, the Department determined that it did not result in an appropriate relief determination.
This is the Department’s first step in addressing borrower defense claims as well as the underlying regulations. The Department will be pursuing additional actions, including re-regulation, in the future.
The Department will begin applying this new approach today and affected borrowers will receive notices from the Department over the next several weeks with discharges following after that. Updated information for borrowers will be posted to StudentAid.gov/borrower-defense.""",33,139,StudentLoans,3965

I got a lot of encouraging responses, so I figured I’d provide a status update! It’s 3 months in, 1/4th if the year is over, and I’ve officially paid off 1/4th of my student loan debt!

It’s been really hard because it’s our slow season at work now so I’m trying to be prudent but also ambitious. I keep track using a Debt Free Chart. One thing that also helped was laying out my entire financial goals for the next 3 years, which include paying off credit cards, saving for a big emergency fund, and a down payment. It’s nice to visually see my progress and know that this debt is just a small part of my overall financial goals.

Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy❤️

After many years of very bad temp jobs, I finally got a decent job and paid about $600/month for close to 10 years, up until Covid. It seems I barely made a dent in them in 10 years, particularly because I skipped maybe one month per year due to medical or car expenses. 

Because my loans are FFEL and with Navient, I have not been eligible for the Covid deferments. However, I used forbearance and accrued interest over the last year in order to save up an emergency fund. (I have been extremely stupid about these loans. I did not think I was accruing interest this past year because I thought interest was suspended on all federal loans.)

My two loans are at 5.375% interest but a direct consolidation would put them at 5.5% interest. How bad is that increase if I'm going to try to pay these off in 10 years or less? Will the current deferment through September make this worthwhile, even if it takes 90 days for the consolidation to go through?(side note: I did a consolidation many years ago and I read somewhere you can only consolidate once so not sure if that applies to me or not.)

[studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) shows me at 86k principal with $4200 in accrued interest. If I have about $5k to throw at this problem right now (about 60% of my emergency fund), does it make sense to just pay that accrued interest now so it's not added to the principal?

tl;dr

1. Consolidate two 5.375% interest loans to a 5.5% Direct loan to take advantage of the current deferment for the last few months (the consolidation could take 90 days)
2. Accrued interest, is it best to pay recently accrued interest if I can?

The catch is I have to show proof of my monthly payment/bill as justification for the amount. 

I’ve looked at the different plans, and for all I can tell, I can’t “pick” my payment to be artificially high using the plans listed on my servicer/DoE website. I can do the repayment calculator on the DoE site and “pick” my monthly payment to be whatever I want or choose a payoff date. The calculator spits out the REPAYE plan with a monthly payment of $688-$767 and an apply for payment button below. Would the $688-$767 be my “billed” payment, or would it be something lower with me contributing the difference on my own?

I’ve also thought about getting a personal loan for $19k and having the repayment term be 2 years but the interest is ~10%. I wouldn’t pay that in the end since my employer’s aid would cover it all.

I'm going to apply to the Borrower Defense program and was wondering if anyone could share their experience/tips for going through with this.

Stating they had students working at big name companies such as Blizzard, Bethesda, and others. It took me about a year to realize that this program doesn't line up with what traditional software engineers do. It had a lot of filler classes and only went up to college algebra. (At the time engines like Unity/UE were still very early. Most engines were custom and a foundational understanding of calculus was, still is but less so, critical to game development)

They said they would not give me my transcripts until I paid my debt. 2.) Most credits weren't being accepted by the community college I switched to at that time.

m640i5,Affording School Post-Transfer,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on this sub and possibly may not be my last. For the last two years, I've gone to community college in order to transfer to a state school. Now, I've gotten into 2 state schools that are local/commuter and 1 school which would be an hour and a half away; tuition is similar for all these schools (ranging from $6.8-7.5k a year). I am also majoring in Accounting and intend on getting my CPA after I get my bachelors, no doubt.

My parents refuse to pay for tuition (I just asked them for help with tuition) if I move away from home, which will inevitably be way more money for me in general. But, the stipulation is they'll pay for my schooling only if I stay home and go to school locally. If I stay home, my education is free because my parents are funding it, but if I leave, the cost will be approx. $40k for the last 2 years.

I don't mind the local schools I got into, but my home life is not ideal. I am 20 y/o and I am still sharing a room with 2 of my adult siblings. My family has lived in a small, two bedroom house my whole life (with 6 of us--parents + my siblings and I, but my oldest sister just moved out) in an apartment complex. I lack a LOT of privacy because my family and I are always holed up together. Another issue I have with my living arrangement is my lack of parking and, thus, freedom. Since we live in an apartment complex, my parents always make me save parking on the street, but because they're paranoid other cars will fill up the street before me, they never let me drive my car unless I have to (classes are okay, but they see clubs as a waste of time so I most likely wouldn't be able to join orgs to network and make friends like I want to). Another thing that's been stressing me out are my parents; it can be really toxic at home and my mom cares about me, but she's heavily depressed and unloads it on me which has affected me mentally since I was in high school and I want to be able to get away for just 2 years.

If I leave, I would be accumulating about $30k in loans and most likely just work part time to pay for expenses and such. I can see if what I'm saying sounds like a first world problem and I seem foolish for giving up free college, but it sounds tempting since I've already paid less than $1000 for 2 years of college and my home life ain't great. I want to be given the harsh truth or see opinions from people who have been dealing with loans. If this isn't allowed, I am okay with removing it.",2,5,StudentLoans,2495
m62ir8,Student loans aren't enough to pay for college - is this a sick joke?,"&gt;!Rant!&lt;

Recently learned that the total cost including meal plan, housing, tuition, and fees at the college I want to go to are $8,900 per semester. Two semesters/year = $17,800/year. Maximum federal loan amount is $12,500 per year. I see a lot of people on this sub saying that they're stressed about student loans, but shit, at least you were able to even get enough loans to pay for your education. I always thought the real challenge was deciding to take on the debt. Didn't realize another challenge would even be acquiring enough debt in the first place. My situation is the opposite. I WANT the debt. I want to take out a big loan so I can not worry about working some shitty part time job and juggling homework at the same time. I want to focus on college while I'm in college and work hard when I get a real, salaried job. Is this such a crazy concept? I'm pissed. Gonna look into private loans. Jesus dude, I always thought the hard part was paying OFF the debt (Which I am frugal and won't have a problem with that), not ACQUIRING it.

Edit: Currently getting no help from parents, getting my AS at a CC. I will be 23 so will be considered independent by the time I graduate from CC. Will be majoring in computer science. My credit score is 750. People say work during the summer, but that's a given for me. I already have to worry about covering rent, regardless of whether classes are in session or not. That's why I want a big loan, because I want to use the money from the loan to cover rent so I can actually give some space for doing schoolwork. Why even go to college if you're just gonna be running back and forth from work to class and spreading your energy so thin that you just suck at everything? Who in their right mind would sign up for that?

Takeaways: 

1. Avoid private loans. 

2.

m5lnqs,Question about accepting loans and signing the MPN,"Greetings all.

&#x200B;

I need to accept the unsubsidized and graduate PLUS loans for a program (let's say school A) I have on my docket ASAP, or I risk missing the payment deadline and incurring late fees. I also have to sign the MPN as well as some of the other documents.

In the meantime, I am waiting to hear back from a program I really like. I don't think I can wait until they get back to me before accepting the loans at school A, signing the MPN and the other documents, etc.

My question is, if I do all of this for school A, and school B gets back to me with an acceptance/offer, what would happen then? Would I be completely screwed over at that point because I accepted the loans and signed the documentation?

m5kzop,Finito,"3 Years after graduating I can finally say that I am debt free. 30k in 3 years. 40k/52k/72.5k salary progression.

1st year I only worked 5 months, took some time off to take classes for CPA fulfillment requirements. Still living at home.  No progress on loans

2nd year finally passed the exam who knows how many 1000's of dollars later, landed a big boy job and signed my first lease with a roommate the week before lockdown began. COVID meant no travelling, no weekends out, no extracurriculars which undoubtedly helped. Started throwing 1000-1500 payments at a time. Sometimes I would be up at 3am, see my paycheck hit and automatically send the money out.

3rd year:

Today, with the stimulus package, my net worth is somewhere around +500. Going to request payments made to fedloan back up to 10,000 to hold on to just in case there's forgiveness, because there is really no downside.

Plans for the future. Double my salary within the next year. Find more fulfilling work. My biggest problem personally now is boredom and unfulfillment. But luckily without the shackles of debt, I am a little free-er to explore the possibilities. Honestly I'm looking forward to living in the moment a little more.

If I could do it all over again, I would work harder in school. Double Major in Mech E and Business. The loans would not have been such a big issue if I was more interested in my work, or if I had a healthier social life or if I had any sense of what the hell I wanted to do with my life. But there are reasons why I made all the decisions that I made, and each of them taught me something, so here's to the future which seems like an open road. One of the biggest lessons is that everything is a grind. Life is a grind. Learn to appreciate the little moments. When I had no job, no prospects and no life, I always found a moment I could be thankful for- for example having a warm cup of coffee before studying. If I had to give loan advice I would say, limit total loans to 50% of the low salary end of your dream job. I don't regret the loans, I regret not maximizing loan value by utilizing my time in the best way.

I'd like to thank my parents for letting me live at home rent free that first year. All the jobs who took a chance on me.  Dave Ramsey who was there for me in the morning and at night and whenever I needed some reassurance. I don't believe in god but I'd like to thank the universe for blessing me with health, the opportunity to grow, consequences for my dumb decisions, oh and also for my pure dumb luck of being an american citizen and living in the most opportunity rich country on the planet.

Good luck to everybody. I wish you all the best on your journey,",18,130,StudentLoans,2690
m5gvk9,Unexpected Student Debt in Australia," 

Hello  everyone in this sub!! I am a US citizen, but a few years ago I had a  chance to study abroad in Australia. Due to some personal reasons, I  dropped out and moved out of Australia. Recently, I received an email  from my old university and its creditor saying that I still have a  tuition debt that needs to be paid, and the amount is equal to the  tuition of a full time student in one term.

I  am really surprised because I am certain that I already submitted a  request to discontinue my course before the starting day of that term.  Also, I have not come back to Australia since the day I moved out.

What  should I do in this situation before contacting the school? I remember  an advice that I should not contact the creditor before receiving proper  advice, so that's why I come here today.

Thanks a lot.",8,2,StudentLoans,822

A few random things to note:

• I currently work for an employer that will pay off my loans if I stay here for 3 years. They pay 21% after 1 year of employment, 29% after two years, and the remaining 50% after three years. I definitely am going to do a year here but I’m not sure if I want to do much more after that. Also a catch to this is I still have to be making payments in between. My employer only gives lump sum checks at the end of each year. 

• I have a decent emergency savings account. Enough to cover about 6 months of expenses should I lose my job. I could realistically afford to pay $2-300/month without dipping into my savings. 

Bottom line is I want financial freedom and to be debt free as soon as possible. But is it wiser for me to just save my money while we have this temporary hold on student loans then let my employer pay over the course of three years?

(in hindsight I wish we didn’t). We borrowed a total 115k by the end of 2013. Now I owe 170k in student loans. I no longer live in the US, as I completed my one year work experience then left given the Trumpian political climate. As it stands I am buying USD and wiring it to pay my loans which is astronomically difficult. I am at my limit but grateful that the pandemic has impacted the economy in such a way that it reduces the variable interest rates. So my payments are lower now but I still have a large amount to pay back with almost no end in sight. 

In 2018, I tried refinancing but it was rejected on the basis that the loan amounts were too much and my debt to income ratio was too high. 

Is there a way that I can return to the US and to legally work and pay them off ??

My monthly payments were $2200 per month and I  asked for a repayment plan due to hardship. They placed me in an “income-driven” repayment plan which extended the time to pay back the loans by 15 yrs( it was originally 2033 now its 2048). I didn’t even know my type of plan  was an “income-driven” as they did not ask me for my pay slips or any information to calculate what I can pay. Anywhoos they just told me I had to pay $1658 which would be automatically be deducted from my account each month. (Please bare in my mind tht
every cent I make goes to changing currency to pay my loans) 

Since then the monthly payments reduced lower than the $1658 due to the impact of COVID on the interest rates and I asked them to stop the Income Driven Repayment Plan. They stopped the plan but did not change the estimated pay off date. 

Should I be concerned that they did not put the estimated date back to 2033 ?  

Just in the way, reddit users salvaged gamestop from plummetting on the stockmarket. is there a way to protest navients predatory and even justified unethical behaviour ???

Is there something I missed in the refinancing process ? 

It blows my mind that Ive borrowed 115k and then by the end of repayment I am slated to pay back approximately $400K USD 😣

My situation is that I recently got into Columbia for grad school, coming from a no-name undergrad, and was stoked before I started looking more closely at the numbers. I didn’t get financial aid or scholarships, and tuition is $90k. Add on $30k of living costs in NYC for the one-year program, and I’m staring at a $120k-shaped hole in my future. The salaries I could earn in the field are probably around $80k if I do VERY WELL in snagging my first job. After tax, that’s $50k ish ... if half of that is gone to pay loans annually, I have to try and live on $2k a month when that’s pretty much the going rate for a room in NYC these days.

I have a plan to pay off my student loans and wanted to get some feedback from others to see if this is the right way to do things.  I owe about $42K and my plan is to pay them off as quickly and aggressively as possible.  I am laser-focused.  My phone background is my Navient loan statement so every time I open my phone, my loan balance is the first thing I see- helps stop the Amazon splurges.  All my loans are Direct/Stafford, I have paid off all private loans (yay!).  I don't work in an industry that qualifies for PSLF.      

I am hopeful for any Biden Administration student loan forgiveness, but I am not getting my hopes up.  All my loans are Federal, so while the pause is going on, I am not paying them.  I would hate to keep paying and then there is some blanket forgiveness where that money could have been put into savings or paid against my mortgage.  I recognize the benefit of the $0% interest period, so I am putting the amount I *would* pay monthly to the side.  If there is forgiveness, great.  If not, I've got the money ready to go and will make a big payment in mid-September, before the freeze ends.    Thoughts?

My question is about what to do after the freeze and I have to start paying again.  Do I refinance or doing income-based repayment?  Can I do both?  I don't know much about refinancing my loans but I don't like the idea of having my Federal loans turned into private ones.  I feel as though it would be smart to do an income-based repayment plan to have the lowest possible payment and then throw all extra against the principle.  Haven't decided if I want to do snowball or avalanche- I like snowball for the gratification but I also understand the benefit of paying off the highest interest rate first.

I understand that loans are going to be a reality, so lets not kid myself. I plan to have between $48k and $88k in total loans(Federal and other) - I am waiting on a re-review from my college to determine if I can get more aid which is why there is such a large disparity of potential loans totals. I plan to have at the very tippy top most $61k in Texas College Access / CAL / HHLoans. Has anyone ever used a CAL Loan? They have an acceptable interest rate 4.20% but they DONT capitalize. Which I think is a big deal. These are loans in my name, cosigned by a parent. So I am required to have an adequate history in order to be approved. I have no concern about being approved for this, nor am I concerned about my mother being approved as a cosigner. However, there is one thing I am worried about: 

Favorable Credit Evaluation Requirements

Students or cosigners must:

* Have an Experian VantageScore of 650 or higher
* Not have public records such as tax liens or bankruptcy proceedings
* ***Have a minimum of four credit trade lines, excluding student loans or authorized user accounts***
* Not have defaulted on any federal or private education loans

In line with financial industry practice, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board reports account obligations to the credit reporting agencies. The reporting is at the loan level, with each loan reported as a tradeline. Cosigners are equally responsible for the repayment of the loan if the student fails to meet his or her repayment obligation.

## Repayment

* Loans have a six-month grace period from the date a borrower ceases to be enrolled at least half-time at an eligible institution.
* Principal balances under $30,000 have up to a ten-year repayment period with minimum monthly payments of $50.
* Principal balances of $30,000 or more have a repayment period up to 20 years.
* The loan will not be sold to another lender.
* Postponements of loan repayment and income-sensitive or graduated repayment schedules are available.

Based on my calculations, REPAYE appears to be the best IDR for me, largely due to the 50% interest forgiveness. However, my partner and I are getting married within the next year, and I know that REPAYE considers your spouse's income regardless of whether or not you file taxes jointly. 

We are therefore considering domestic partnership. We are likely moving to California, and their domestic partnership program provides some spousal benefits but is not recognized by the federal government. Because it is not recognized by the federal government, I am inclined to believe that his income will not affect REPAYE. Is this correct?

m47akn,Second Bachelors degree + grad degree,"Hi! I have been accepted to an excellent nursing program that I would really love to attend. It’s a ~1 year accelerated Bachelors of Science in Nursing, followed by ~3 years of graduate coursework to become a Family Nurse Practitioner. My original plan was to find the entire program (about $250k for 4 years) with federal loans - as many direct sub/unsub stafford loans as possible and then Direct PLUS loans for the rest. My plan is also to go for PSLF (I know there’s a different subreddit for PSLF and my question is not about that). My problem now is that because the BSN year is technically a second undergraduate degree and not a grad degree (I already have a B.S in Biology, with about $30k in federal loans), I am only eligible for $12,500 in federal loans because there are no Direct PLUS loans available to Independent undergraduate students. Also, I will be 25 when I start the program, so a Parent PLUS loan isn’t an option either. The BSN year alone is about $70k of the total $250k. To cover the huge remainder, I would need a private loan, which I was hoping to avoid for obvious reasons.

My question is: is there anything stopping me from maxing out my Direct PLUS loans during the graduate years, and using those direct plus loans to pay down on my private loan, effectively “transferring” my private loan to federal loans thus making them eligible for IBR? Obviously I would use the Direct PLUS loans for my tuition/living expenses first during those graduate years, but I the official cost of attendance that is the limit for the Direct PLUS loans is a lot higher than what my actual cost of attendance would be (based on living with roommates, etc), so I’m thinking if I max them out there will be enough left over for me to pay on the private loan. Does anyone have any thoughts on why I couldn’t/shouldn’t do this? 

Alternatively, I have good enough credit to get a low interest rate on a private loan, and should be making a good enough salary at the end of my program that I could go for IBR for my federal loans and be really aggressive about paying down my private loan, but plan A would be this federal loan “transfer” of sorts.",18,1,StudentLoans,2158

m41abe,Hit my undergrad aggregate limit,"Hi everyone. So I’m in a dilemma. I basically went to a four year university and used up at 580% of my pell grant. I’m at 53/57k for my loans. However i recent got accepted into Arizona state for a different program and degree that I’d like to complete. It’s going to take me about a year and a half to finish it. However with that being said i don’t have much to work with. I do work full time but have my own place, my car payment, other things to pay for so i wouldn’t really be able to pay for my tuition. Does anyone have any ideas?? I’m past the 24 year old age limit for an increase in the loan amount. I’m not sure if there’s any way to work around this to increase the amount i get or if anyone has run into a similar circumstance! Also I’ve applied for some scholarships but i don’t think that will solve my problems completely.

I am a HS student who has to take out student loans except I am kinda in a difficult spot. 

I live 30 mins away from the college I want to go to. During traffic/rush hour, it is closer to an 1hr away. I have the option to live at home because I am within 45 miles of the campus. My parents are encouraging me to live at home as well. If I choose to live at home, my parents can help pay off most, if not all, of my student loans since they're not spending money on housing. If I want to live near/on campus, I would be left with more debt since they're spending money on housing.

I want to live on campus because its convenient and I had a crappy senior year, so I want to get out and meet new people and make connections for my major. Obviously, if classes end up being mostly online, Ill live at home (idc where I have to zoom from). I am worried ill be stressed with the commute, get less sleep, and be less focused on my academics and extracurriculars. 

I am in a living-learning program as well where it is recommended to live on campus for the first year to gain the most from this program. 

So my question is, is it worth it to live on campus and have loans? Do you gain a lot from living on campus? Or is it smarter to stay at home at have less loans? I know the obvious answer is ""less loans! duh!"" but I really want the college experience and making connections is really important for my major.

At the same time, my partner and I are also hoping to buy a house in the next few years. My partner does not have any debt and makes a good bit more money than I do (though not much credit history, either). My debt-to-income ratio is pretty significant, but between the two of us, it is much more reasonable. We have been saving pretty aggressively to be able to put down a sizeable down payment when the time comes.
 
So my question is this: when I start grad school, would I be better off if I deferred my loans and only paid the interest so that we can save as much cash as possible toward a house? Or should we get more aggressive about paying off as much debt as possible before taking out a mortgage? Or some combination of the two?

m3qoul,Re-Certify IDR conundrum for newly married,"It's time to re-certify my IDR plan and as a newly married (last summer) person I knew that my husband and I would have to file our taxes as Married Filing Separately (MFS) so that we would not have to include each others income in our respective IDR plans for our separate Student Loans. 

When I called to get help filling out the form the CS person wanted me to choose ""Married"" rather than ""Married but cannot access souses income info."" 

-------------------------------

This is how ""Married"" goes:

----------------------------------

1. Married - Continue to Item 8.
2. (8) Does your spouse have federal student loans? Yes - Continue to Item 9.
3. (9) Provide the following information about your spouse (Spouse's SSN, Spouse's Name,Spouse's Date of Birth) and then continue to Item 10:
4. (10) When you filed your last federal income tax return, did you file jointly with your spouse? No - Skip to Item 17.
5. (17) Has your income significantly decreased since you filed your last federal income tax return? No - Provide your most recent federal income tax return or transcript. Skip to Item 19.
6. (19) Has your spouse's income significantly decreased since your spouse filed his or her last federal income tax return? No - Provide your spouse's most recent federal income tax return or transcript. This information will only be used if you are on or placed on the REPAYE Plan. Skip to Section 6.
7. (Section 6) Provide all your Spouse's income records.
--------------------------------------

So I asked her way I should fill out the application this way rather than ""Married But Cannot Access""? And wouldn't this cause us to have to pay according to both of our incomes? 

She said - because then I will have my IDR calculated based on a 2 person house hold rather than a 1 person house hold. - which sounds good to me... 

But I'm sitting here looking at this form where they want to know the income of my spouse and I'm feeling suspicious. If they want to calculate my IDR on my being married why do they need his income information? 

My spouse and I both have outrageous student loans from 35+ years of compound interest and neither of us want the others income to impact our IDR plans. Why in the world would I give them my husband's information?

So who here does this IDR form as just Married? Seems like that's the way to have them include your spouse's income...

I hope this makes sense.

I’m not sure what the threshold is but that was his income. I called and asked if he qualified for income driven repayment. They said no but they wouldn’t give me information as to why not. After a lot of digging I found out it was because He had four plus loans, one for each year of my school. I had those loans consolidated into one parent plus loan. By doing so, he then qualified for income driven repayment. His income driven repayment qualifies him to make a $0 payment per month. If he remains under this income for 25 years, loan is forgiven. Same result if he ever passes away. He is 75, and has no plan to return to work and increase his income, so I’m sure you can do the math.

Want to fix student loans? Forgiving them is not the way to go. Start by dropping all interest rates to 1% and write into law that they can never exceed that. Next, apply all payments to principal in full, interest is paid off last and is not accrued on itself. The IRS does it, why can't the DOE. Then, adjust all amounts owed to reflect the 1% interest rate as if it was applicable for the entire life of the loan. Finally, retroactively apply the same 1% interest rate and payment terms to all federal loans held in the last 20-30 years and refund the overpayment amounts in the form of a tax credit of 20% of the amount up to $5000 a year for 5 years.

Prodigy has excluded Canadian students as a whole temporarily, and MPower won't lend to anyone who isn't within 2 years of graduation (law school is 3 years). I phoned all the major Canadian banks and asked if I could take out a line of credit. No luck, since I'm studying abroad.

m2vsj3,Son Going Off to College in the Fall,"My partner and I have been together for about 5 years. Her son, which I have fully embraced as my own, is graduating this year and has been accepted to Ohio University in the fall. What follows is an outline of what he has been offered: 

Gift Aid Offered Annually: (Grants and Scholarships)

1. OHIO Excellence Scholarship: $1k
2. OHIO Forward Award: $500
3. Federal Pell Grant: $6495
4. Federal Supplemental Ed. Opp. Grant (SEOG): $1500
5. Estimated Ohio College Opportunity Grant (OCOG): $2K  

GIFT AID TOTAL: $11495

Self-Help Aid Offered Annually:

1. Federal Work Study: $2640
2. Federal Direct Subsidized Loan: $3500
3. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan: $2k

SELF-HELP TOTAL: $8140 

\*Next to the Federal Work Study number offered there is a $0 in ""Applicable Aid."" I assume he didn't sign up for work study and that's why it shows $0 applied. Perhaps he hasn't made it clear to the university that he wishes to pursue work study opportunities. In short, I'm not sure why that says that. 

He will be living on campus and his mother wants him to get a meal plan. I went to college and I didn't have a meal plan and I was fine, a lot of pizza and chicken fingers, but fine. The plan is just over $4K annually and I was wondering if that could be somewhere we could trim some fat as it were. Thoughts on that would be helpful. 

Mostly it is a question of difference. After all aid is applied, minus work study, because I'm not sure what's going on there, there is still a $7535 difference, or out-of-pocket expense for the boy. I have done nothing but think about how he is going to come up with this extra $7K. His family, namely his grandparents and his mother, whom I completely support, are adamant about his ability/responsibility to pay for his own education. 

The $7535 difference is annual which means split between two semesters. Which is $3767.5 minus any taxes per semester. If he took advantage of the OU work study program he could earn another $2640, which is pretty light for any kind of work ($1320 per semester) but it would still knock the total down to  a $4895 annual difference or $2447.5 per semester. 

He's had a job near his hometown for nearly 2 years and hopes to be able to continue working for them when he arrives in Athens as there is a store there. So he will be earning an income while attending classes. \*Perhaps this is part of the work study answer. The plot thickens. 

So lets say he does intend on not accepting any kind of work study and he has a balance of $3767.5 per semester. How does he go about paying this. He is working now and does fairly well. I don't believe that he could even come close to saving that kind of money before OU bills are due. He just turned 18 and has no credit. His mother and I don't have the best credit but we are making positive strides. Too much music and dancing in our 20s if you catch my drift. 

I just want to be able to help him. I'll get another job or cosign on a loan for him if it will get him where he wants to be.

To my understanding, in a normal situation outside of Financial Aid, if a person under the age of 18 were to apply for a loan they would need to have a co-signer.

Assuming the student is a dependent student: Is a co-signer not needed because the parent has provided their tax information? Please help me understand the mechanics behind this :-)",1,3,StudentLoans,528
m2bizv,Perkins loan forgiveness help (ECSI),"Hi all,

My partner has federal Perkins Loans that we've been working through forgiveness for and currently am on year 4. She recently changed schools this school year to another title 1 school. We sent all the documents in and we've been going in this back and forth (it's exhausting... so many things where we had to send back the entire application or attaching documents for: wet live signature, school name correction, forbearance / forgiveness needing separate apps, etc.) each taking about 1-2 weeks for them to come with a response. So this has been a long process. Now it is time for her to start paying monthly since last year's forbearance has worn off.

The latest update we got from ECSI is that her school is not listed on the federal website for title 1 schools (https://studentaid.gov/tcli/directory-search) so she is not eligible anymore despite the school having 100% of the kids categorized as low income students. Her school admins and ceo (public charter) have all confirmed that it is a title 1 school and the government treats them as such. Granted this is a fairly new school in the area and is only 2 years old.

From here (https://www.nslp.org/teacher-loan-forgiveness/) it says the school needs to contact the agency in the state to report this. However I don't see any schools listed for 2020-2021 so are we just stuck paying off this loan until it shows on the list next year?

The school doesn't seem to be very knowledgeable on reporting this to the federal agency so does anyone know how my partner can guide them towards this process? Not sure if they actually don't know or if it's just not high of a priority for them.

Either way it looks like this will take some work and some time which sucks because she'll be paying $100 per month until this gets sorted out but better to at least get started now and hopefully get the rest forgiven.

Appreciate any help we can get!",8,5,StudentLoans,1906

m1nv4n,Loans have aged off -- Rehab Question,"Hey everyone... TIA for any info! Looking for help not judgment and reading around this is definitely a safe space -- so thank you! 

I took out a few Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) as a student in 2003/2004. The lender was a chain bank that is no longer in business. In 2007 I consolidated the loans into one loan which totaled $16,000ish dollars. I continued to default (long story). I have never a single cent as of now except for when they take my tax return usually. 

Eventually the loans no longer showed on my credit. And in the last 5 years I have built a great credit score through cards and a car loan. 

Curious about the Cares Act/ loan interest suspension/possible Biden forgiveness etc. I created and account on studentaid.gov last month and see that I have: $16,000ish principal and $12,000ish interest (OMG THE INTEREST!!!) for a total owing of about $29,000ish. 

It says my debt is handled by something called Debt Management and Collections System. What is that? Does that mean privately held or technically do the feds still own it? I read something somewhere about Federal loans prior to 2010 being different?

My work has had Covid hour cuts and us off and on unemployment since this hit. I make about $30,000 a year but no that much this last year due to the Covid stuff. Im barely making it right now. 

MY QUESTIONS: 

What kind of rehab should I apply for?

m1kg2r,Student debt owed to school after 10 years.,"I went to a state university for one year, 2010-2011. I ended up dropping out due some family issues in the spring for 2011. According to the school, I was denied financial aid for spring term 2011 in which resulted in a $5000 balance that was unpaid. For that, I was never notified. I did, however, pay off the fed loan debt in 2013. I have proof of that. I have gone 10 years thinking I was debt free. 

Fast forward to this year when I received a “Notice of Refund Offset” from the Department of Revenue stating that my refund was used to pay a delinquent debt from this school. I called DOR and they said they don’t know about it and to call the school. 

I called the school. They go through my ten year old, archived account and found that I had paid of the student loans and they could not find anything that was delinquent, that it was a mistake. So we do our goodbyes, etc. 

I just got a call back saying that in fact I do have a delinquent account of $15,000 ($5000 principal and $10000 in interest over 10 years) owed to the school from the spring term of 2011 where I was denied aid. The only contact they have done over the last ten years was a phone call in late 2011 to discuss the repayment of the fed loans (never about this “loan”), the account lady even mentioned that it was about fed loans and not this account. 

This “loan” was never reported to any of the major credit reports and this is the first time I’m hearing of this account. When I brought that up, she said that they don’t chase people to pay their accounts and everything would have been sent via student email (that she stated was disabled in 2011 because I was no longer a student so I was, again, never aware of this debt). 

At this point, she has laid my options out as 1. Pay the $15,000 in full today or she can 2. Talk to her boss about getting half of the interest removed and only have to pay $10,000 (principal and half interest). 


My questions are, at this point, why was I never contacted about this debt? Why has it taken 10 years for them to finally notify me about this debt? Obviously, I had paid off the other debts for this school, I’m 100%  sure I would have paid this debt as well if I would have just known about it. 

What are my options at this point? I have gone 10 years believing I was debt free only to find out that they’re going to start a garnishment now because it has been unpaid for so long. I don’t have $10,000 let alone $15,000 laying around to pay it off.",3,2,StudentLoans,2480

Instead of doing a large road trip with my college friends due to Covid, I moved home after graduation because I was WFH and live in a HCOL city. I acknowledge that I was lucky enough to save on rent, avoid buying a car to commute to work, and other daily expenses.

However, I'm still very proud of where I am and wanted to share my story on this anonymous internet forum. I don't talk to my friends about my debt because it's a bit embarrassing but here are the details:

* Total: $104k of student loans @ graduation
   * $70k private (includes accumulated interest)
      * $25k initial principle loan at 8.45% (!) variable interest
      * $7k initial principle loan at 8.36% (!) variable interest
      * $21k initial principle loan at 9.41% (!!!) variable interest
   * Refinance #1 (Sofi, May 2020): $71k initial principle, 5.28% fixed
      * Looking back, I would have to crunch the numbers to see if this was smart. I capitalized all the accumulated interest (\~$17k) from the private loans above, but I greatly reduced the interest on all the loans. In the end, I'm happy with my decision regardless
   * Refinance #2 (Citizens, Jan 2021): $51k initial principle, 3.85% fixed
      * As you can see I paid \~$20k off from May 2020-Dec 2020 then cashed in on great private student loan rates
      * Today, I sit at $42k in private student loans remaining (40% down from the start!)
   * $31k federal loans
      * Have not paid due to 0% interest freeze. My goal is to reach $31k in private loans by the end of September (current interest freeze end date) then evaluate - all but one of my federal loans has higher interest than my refinanced private loan.
* Income (occupation: electrical engineer)
   * $56k base
      * $18k bonuses
* Retirement savings
   * Maxed out contributions to my Roth IRA ($6k) in 2020
   * Contributed 10% of my paycheck (5% roth, 5% pre-tax) each month and lumped in $4k of that bonus (>$8k total now)
* General savings
   * I also opened up a high-yield savings account and have saved $11k as I plan on moving to a new state later this year because my partner is pursuing a graduate degree (she is debt-free and will not be taking on debt for grad school - we are open about our financial situations and she supports my aggressive payback strategy)

nd27rv,Lessons learned from mitigating radon in our home,"Just got through warranty mitigation, and have some takeaways I thought I would share...

1. **Choose a contractor that mitigates to the WHO 2.7 pCi/L number, not the EPA number.** With ionizing radiation, there is no truly 'safe' number so the guideline is 'As Low As Reasonably Achievable' or ALARA.
2. **If you can, find a mitigation contractor that is local to your town or neighborhood.** If they need to revisit to perform additional warranty mitigation, then they can fit you in as they come and go to other jobs much more easily than if they would have to make a special trip out to you for no additional profit.
3. **Due diligence, ask for the ACORD liability insurance forms, NRPP cert and state licensure if applicable.** This is all a matter of personal risk, and I am personally very risk averse. I suggest at a minimum validating that every contractor you work with can present current ACORD forms showing limits and in-force policies. 'Chuck in a Truck' might not have all this and be cheaper, but you will eat the whole meal and then some if he fucks up.
4. **Purchase a direct reading instrument and continuously collect measurements for a month post mitigation.** I purchased the Air Things Corentium, and it works great for tracking short term and long term averages in pCi/L. Radon levels are highly subject to hydrostatic and air pressure. Air pressure above STP will keep the radon down since there is no 'suction' drawing it out. Conversely, if it rains then you have low air pressure preceding that and that creates a suction effect which draws the radon out. You need to verify that your mitigation systems functions below warranty levels during worst-case exposures.
5. **Talk with multiple contractors to hear their approaches to mitigation.** Some dudes may say they need to encapsulate everything and your grandmother. You may need to encapsulate a piece of your basement if its unfinished or crawl, but probably not the slab.

Hope this helps!",0,1,HomeImprovement,1973
nd2721,Exterior Sheathing Replacement Issue,"I had a small water leak into my wall (between sheathing and drywall) from a bad window. Issue I’m having is we still have a mildew smell despite ripping out the drywall and drying everything out. I’ve confirmed there is no more water intrusion as the window has been replaced and my moisture meter isn’t reading any moisture in remaining drywall or studs.

However, we still get a mildew smell, particularly at night. I think it’s coming from the compromised sheathing which is something called Thermo-ply (home built in 1987). It’s basically 1/8 inch cardboard with a vapor barrier painted on the outside facing portion. I want to replace this, but can’t find it anywhere.

I can’t just replace with ½ cdx and Tyvek wrap because I can’t get the ½ cdx under the Window flanges. What I’d like to do is replace with some 1/8 or  ¼ inch plywood with Tyvek over it. Would this work? I know that kind of plywood is generally used for interior applications. The siding is Cedar rabbeted bevel siding.

ncz2mh,Lightweight no drill fixture for 150yo sandstone walls?,"Hi there

I'd like to attach some fixtures to train a plant along wires outside my 1880's house which is built from sandstone. The idea is that the plant is visible from the inside so the wires will go along the inner part of the window bay (the windows are in recess).

As you can imagine, it's quite crumbly, even moreso because it's the south facing one. I can't/won't drill under any circumstances. The plant (clematis) is very lightweight and safety isn't an issue, so I was thinking to experiment with some kind of mortar. However they all recommend a clean and dust-free base, which by nature sandstone never is. Stone glue could be an option but it shouldn't chemically damage the wall (eg with a low pH).

Has anyone got any experience or ideas on this?

Cheers

edit: wonky image of the situation, you can see the clematis just about peeking round, i want to see it grow around the inner bit of the frame so it's nicely visible from indoors. [https://imgur.com/a/u5R6VN8](https://imgur.com/a/u5R6VN8)",6,4,HomeImprovement,1020

nd4ol1,"Old house electrical question, how lucky am I?","Preface: I'm going to have an electrician come out to verify, but I'm curious as to how high my hopes should be.

TLDR: Electrical has been worked on a couple times on my old house. I have a box with two 100 amp breakers at the service, an old box with non-metallic and a bunch of 2-prong outlets, and a new box with 3-wire romex and 3-prong outlets.  How likely is it that the old box is grounded (through the 200 amp feeder box) and they just didn't run new 3-wire everywhere?

We moved into an old (1923) house (SW MI) a few years ago.  The house was original knob/tube/fuse, but has been updated at least twice.  At one point the knob and tube was replaced with 2-wire nonmetallic sheathed wiring and a breaker box installed.  At some later point a 2x100 amp breaker box was installed where service comes in and an additional ""new"" box with 3-wire yellow romex.  

The house has a mix of 3-prong and 2-prong outlets, all of the 3-prong outlets on the main floor are new style boxes and on the new breaker box.

The circuit descriptions on the boxes are NOT current, so I'm tracing what goes where on the new box to see what power I have available for a central AC.  To my surprise, two of the 3-prong outlets in the basement traced to the old box.

I had assumed the old box was ungrounded, thus all the 2-prongs.  But now with two 3-prong outlets tracing to the old box, I'm wondering (hoping) if that box is grounded and they just didn't bother fishing romex and replacing the old outlets.

The 3-prong outlets from the old box I found show as grounded on power strips and a meter, but I'm not sure if that's a ""real"" ground or an incidental ground.

So, it has a fireplace with original gas log starter, typical key on the wall next to it, etc.

However, the gas line was run such that it pops out from the center of the fireplace floor. Attached to this was a tee with 12"" lengths of pipes with vents for the flame every 4 inches. Like [so. ](https://i.imgur.com/i8pcyUf.jpg) these were rusted and pretty much falling off, so I carefully unscrewed the tee and that's that.

However, I'd really prefer to run gas logs. I prefer to do my smokin on the bbq outside lol, and gas is cheaper than quality firewood here. And again, this is Texas, so it's really just decorative.

The problem: all gas log burners that I can find seem to assume that the gas is coming in from one side or the other, not the center. I can find some outdoor fire pit burners with a central inlet, but that doesn't seem like a great match.

How do I best reposition this gas outlet? I have no easy access as it is a brick fireplace. Is it most feasible to pull up the few bricks on the the fireplace floor?
Can I put on a 90 and then a 12"" run to the left or right on top of the floor? I'm not sure how to fit the burner around that and it seems like heat may be an issue unless I can put some sort of radiant barrier on top.

I don't need this done ASAP obviously because it will be quite a few months before I would ever want it on, but if I need to do some demo I'd rather do it before I put down new floors.

nd75uv,Need help: how to best approach uneven grade between backyards when replacing fence and gate?,"As the title says, we are building a fence along my property line to replace the original fence that is falling over. We are also replacing seventy-year-old Gates near the original location. The fence is shared between myself and neighbor. We are splitting the cost.

The issue we are running into is that the neighbor's backyard is at a slightly higher grade than mine for a length of 8-10 feet due to years of erosion building up against the previous fence.

We are looking for the best way to create level entry points for the gate doors and prevent more erosion that would lead to the fence rotting prematurely.

I've placed a pressure-treated 4x6 along the section which is anchored by 3 pieces of 3' rebar on patio paver sand. I am open to removing this if a different approach makes more sense.

nd6mvl,Weather sealing a door,"My goal is to get a good weather-tight seal on my front door. Currently, on the bottom right corner, I can see daylight coming through the crack between the door and the frame. There is a bit of a draft that comes through. There are a few different issues and I'm not sure which ones are most important.   


Please see my photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/7RKCiyV](https://imgur.com/a/7RKCiyV)

  
Here are my observations:  
1. The weather stripping is not torn or cracking. It still seems flexible. Because of the other issues, I don't think I can simply replace the weather stripping and expect that to solve the problem.  
2. There is a metal door sweep on the bottom of the door. The metal is bending away from the door at the ends and this pushes the weather stripping away from the door when the door is closed.  
3. The door is drooping. The gap between the door and the frame is wider at the bottom than the top on the knob side of the door, and wider at the top than the bottom on the hinge side. So, there is a relatively large gap at the point where the daylight shines through. But, the drooping is not severe enough to result in the door rubbing on the frame at all. The door has self-closing hinges and I'm not sure how to correct the door droop with those.  
4. It is not clear to me which factors are contributing to the bad seal: the weather stripping, the door droop, or the bending door sweep. Or, perhaps there's something else I'm not considering.  


I'm not very knowledgeable or skilled with home improvement stuff. I also have a strata requirement to get approval for any renovations involving the door. So, I would like to know:  
1. Is there anything simple I can do to improve the weather seal without changing anything on the door itself?  
2. If changing things on the door is required, what is the most straightforward way to fix the problem?

What do I need to know/do?,"I've been living in a house in NorthWest Lower Michigan for about 5 years and making modest (mostly cosmetic) improvements. The kitchen is the worst room in the house and I have intentionally not touched it because it has looked like such a can of worms. 

I have gotten pretty handy since purchasing a house but I have never taken a room down to studs and started over. I'm going to have some help on the weekends but I'm going to do most of the work myself. Here's what I'm up against:

* Walls and ceiling are awful cardboard stuff - going to tear them out and re-insulate. Walls will be drywall and ceiling will probably be beadboard slats. 
* Floor is awful linoleum and subfloor is an uneven nightmare. Going to replace both. Underneath is a 2' crawlspace over dirt. 
* The electrical that runs underneath the house is old and some of it doesn't work - going to replace what I can. (I have someone who knows electrical pretty well to help there)
* Some of my water pipes are galvenized - going to replace all of that mess with pex (maybe add a whole-home water filter?)
* Replacing all the cabinets and countertops - possibly going with an IKEA system, but I'm also considering concrete countertops. 
* Taking out a (non load-bearing) wall to open the kitchen to the living room and putting a hood in. 
* Adding a little bar on the other side of that. 
* All new lighting


This kitchen includes a washer, (electric) dryer, dishwasher, (gas) stove, and fridge (the fridge is the only thing getting replaced). 

Any and all advice on what to do or not to do, things to consider, and order of operations would be massively appreciated. Specific questions are: What's your favorite flooring - how easy is it to stain a sealed grout if we do tile? What's your favorite countertop - I probably can't afford granite/quartz so I'm looking at either something from IKEA or concrete - any experience with that? What nice little amenities should I build in while I'm tearing the whole thing apart? What am I probably going to screw up?


I'm hoping to keep this project under 20k which I'm pretty sure I can do. The room is roughly 10'x16'. We're going for a industrial/cottage look (stainless steel, beadbord, gingham, etc). 

I know this is kind of a broad catch-all post but any wisdom you can bestow is appreciated - even if it's your favorite YouTube channel or random advice. Thanks everyone.",12,3,HomeImprovement,2394

Goal: I just want to extend the access of the outdoor faucet currently located at the back of of my garage to the front. Since i live in a colder climate (Ontario, Canada), any setup has to be able to be winterized.

My solution (as a newb diy'er): attach a garden hose (old one lying around) and cut it to the length of my garage. attach one end of the hose to my existing faucet at the back of the garage and the other to another faucet to be located at the front end of the garage.

Advice needed: I am looking to purchase a fitting that will connect my hose to the new faucet. the new faucet i purchased has a 1/2 inch male threaded MIP or SWEAT end (link here: [https://www.rona.ca/en/aqua-dynamic-antifreeze-valve-brass-1-2x1-2x10-1104-557-0173459](https://www.rona.ca/en/aqua-dynamic-antifreeze-valve-brass-1-2x1-2x10-1104-557-0173459)). the hose i will be attaching is 5/8 inch in diameter on the inside. Based on preliminary understanding, I should be looking for an adapter that has a 5/8 inch barb with 1/2 inch female MIP or SWEAT. I will be fixing the adapter into the hose using a 5/8 inch hose clamp.

Fyi: I have no idea whether that is the correct adapter. I have no plumbing experience.

nd55e3,Either my house is haunted or I have bigger problems with keeping this house warm,"I am seriously leaning toward the house being haunted as I have heard that when this happens a house can feel cold no matter how high the heat is turned up. 

The problems seem to have started once a ridge vent was installed on the house. I think that whatever had been previously cool with living in the attic got pissed and decided to move inside our house. Now even though it is the middle of May and it is 58 degrees outside and the heat is on 70 it still feels cold. 

My husband told me he has seen a woman at the end of the hallway standing there and yelling (no it's not me) and I didn't believe him but with this cold feeling inside the house constantly I am beginning to wonder.

nd54zt,Soundproof Foam,"Hey all, first time poster, so forgive me if this post isn't appropriate for the sub.

To jump right into it, I'm currently living in a rented house with two roommates. My ""bedroom"", is essentially the entire basement. I asked the landlord to put a door on the top of the steps, and then I put up some curtains to create a sense of ""division"", and then it's basically a sans-kitchen studio apartment. 

Now, what I'm hoping to do going into my second lease is potentially make the basement more soundproof. The noise of people walking above me is fine, but given the top of the stairs goes right into the kitchen, and the only door that could work at that spot was a sliding door, it's incredibly hard not to hear distinct sound in the kitchen.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the mechanics of this thing, but it seems the solution would simply be to get as many soundproof panels/foam that I can, and then cover my ceiling, and the walls by the stairs, so that sound doesnt bounce through the hallway as well. 

I also know that if I blare music or watch a movie, the rest of the house can hear it pretty distinctly. I sometimes like to play games with friends on discord, and that can get pretty loud if Im laughing and being obnoxious, so I'd like to see if I can have my cake and eat it too.

I guess the sum of what I wanted to ask you guys was, how effective is what I described, and how much of it would be necessary? I can go into more specifics on the makeup of the basement and the orientation of some of the upper floors, but generally if I put sound panels all over the ceiling (which, it's an entire basement, so that's kind of a lot), and then on the walls around the like, stair tunnel, how significant of a difference should that make? Is there elements I am missing? ie would walls need it as well?

I’m switching out this battery operated video doorbell with a Google Nest Hello. 

I don’t want to use my doorbell wiring just because there has been known issues with the chime and transformer.

What I’m trying to figure out is if it’s best to wire the power adapter to the covered outlet next to my door. The adapter is rated for indoor use only, but this should be ok. My question is how should I position the adapter wiring. It’s not going to be an issue to run the wire on the left/ride of the door, but the issue comes in on the top of the door as there’s nowhere to conceal the cable. 

The other option is to have someone like OnTech (who does installs for Google) drill a hole from the wall outlet in my kitchen and then outside and below the window.  And then I can run the wire straight to the doorbell.

I called my student loan servicer and asked if I got married on the REPAYE plan, if my spouse's income would be counted as my income, (thus increasing my payment, which would leave us in a very bad place - you can see why this is an important question). I also asked what plan I should move to if I want to keep my payment the same while married. She told me she has never in her life heard of any repayment plan using spousal income to calculate payment, regardless of filing separately or jointly - so go ahead and get married and my payment will only use my income.

I kind of call bs on this because of all the research I have done but it's literally her job to know this and those were the words of my own loan servicer. I asked her twice and she reassured me that my loan payment would not change if I got married.

My wife (and me) are feeling pretty frustrated and confused. She currently owes about $62k in student loans (BA and MA). They are all Stafford Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) and serviced by CFI (College Foundation, Inc). She never consolidated. Her loans didn't qualify for the CARES act because ""Loans serviced by College Foundation, Inc. are neither Direct Loans nor owned by the federal government and were not included in the CARES Act"" which was ok because we were fortunate in that we didn't experience a drop in income throughout the pandemic. Thing is we don't really understand why her loans didn't qualify - they are Stafford loans! Can anyone explain this to me like I'm 5 (or like an 18 year old college freshman about to sign their life away)? 

Also she’s worked in non-profits for 8 years. Her understanding is that, because her loans somehow aren't direct loans, they will not qualify for PSLF?

Finally, we recently turned a decent profit on our house that we just sold. We have the opportunity to pay off her student loans or to put a chunk of change towards our new mortgage, significantly reducing the monthly payment. To us, it makes sense to take care of the student loans because the interest rate is far higher than our mortgage's interest rate, but if she MIGHT qualify for forgiveness soon, or if the government might be forgiving some loans soon, maybe that's not the best option?

Very Recently bought a 1950s home. On one of the interior bedroom walls, There is a very strange, horizontal discoloration.  The stain runs in a completely horizontal line, and is about 3 feet long and maybe 2-3 inches tall. There is zero visual signs of any ""dripping"" stains that you might expect of water stains on a wall, due to gravity. Basically, the ""stain"" is too perfectly round, it almost just looks like a stain from furniture up against the wall (but there is moisture readings, more later)-- or slightly wet paint from a touch up job, but the room hasn't been painted for at least 1 month.

**The mystery is that as far as we can tell, there is absolutely no reason for there to be any pipe whatsoever on this wall.** There is no reason all for a water pipe to be present. We know its an old house and who knows what wonky stuff they did back then, but at no point at all in the houses life was this area close to a water source, and there is certainly no reason for water to be running there now. No signs of moisture in the attic either.

**We bought a $35 moisture reader, and it DOES pop at high %. On one end of the stain, it reads around 10%. On the other end, it reads as high as 18% moisture reading.**  Other walls in the same bedroom read around 2.5% tops. IF you go very near the stain but even just a few inches above it reads around 3% max. And the same wall in the other bedroom reads around 2% tops. 

The home DOES have in wall HVAC ducts (not in the floor or ceiling). The vent is on the other side of the wall where there is no moisture readings.

Anybody have any experience with this sort of mystery? Our best bet is the HVAC duct, but its impossible to say, and the duct would be bigger than the stain.

1. Dry P-trap in unused space - this is unlikely as all of our drains are in use and when I have filled with water in the past this has not alleviated the issue.

2. Broken wax seal in toilet - this is a potential issue but relatively unlikely - all of our toilets have been replaced or resealed in the past 5 years. 

3. Issue with the vent stack - I am leaning towards this being the issue. If it is would a smoke test be the best / only way to identify?

Obviously it'd be significantly easier to put LVP over this linoleum rather than tear it up, but I have two points of concern(https://imgur.com/a/Nqrbi4q) -- there appears to be a cut in the linoleum right next to the shower pan, and then in a corner next to the shower there appears to be possible water damage at least to the molding. Any suggestions about how to proceed--should the linoleum stay or go? If I cut out just the piece of the damaged linoleum just next to the shower pan, do I need some sort of linoleum-thick spacer/material to support the LVP?

ndpzfb,Basement humidity in old houses,"The basement in my 100 year-old house is unfinished. The humidity level during summer is usually high. I use a dehumidifier, but since there is no drain hole in the basement, I have to dump the water from the dehumidifier everyday or every two days.

I read an article recently about basements in old houses. I can’t find the link but the author says that there is no mold problem in most old houses before the existence of dehumidifiers, because the basements were not well insulated. The humidity is a problem that is partly created by modern insulation.

So here is my question: would it be a good idea if I open my basement windows a little bit and make the air flow, instead of using a dehumidifier and letting it run all way?",7,2,HomeImprovement,731

The initial tiles were easy to remove.  As I got to the edge, the tiles started resisting and removing bits of the material under the dried thinset.

I also don’t want to pay a premium if they’re just going to sub out a bunch of work.

The subframe looks good, despite the one beam splitting. We have a few moderately costly projects we need to do, but this has jumped the list because of the botched repairs and our wedding using our backyard next year.

I’m really hesitant to throw a lot of $into this, but it makes sense to replace with trex. It seems like you really have to jump to the top of the line to get much difference in quality of product. We can’t justify that cost or really afford the top of the line, so we were thinking about just getting a the basic. We are in the Midwest. This deck has decent shade and only really concerned about our two par-core expert, large dogs.  Thought being: if there’s not more protection in scratches, it’s really just color choice, we like the cheap colors. That will work.

TLDR: I fucked up and need to replace my deck top. It makes sense to go trex route. But we can’t do transcend, and select seems to be no different from basics. So should we go basics route? 

Questions: who has had BASICS trex. I’ve only seen comments from people with transcend or select. What is your experience with basics? Does it hold up? Fade? Stretch?

Those who have SELECT: why did you go that route (other than color?)  
Do you believe it was worth the cost? At that point, should you just have gone up to transcend or down to basics?

Here's our loosely defined list we will work on over the next couple of weeks:

1. converted garage - new outlets
2. converted garage - light switch moved to the room instead of kitchen
3. converted garage - ceiling fan replaced
4. fixing a loose outlet in the kitchen (wants to come out of the wall?  NOPE.)

ndex9n,Two switch to One switch in bathroom problem.,"I can’t seem to find my mistake so maybe y’all can help me.

I had two switches in the bathroom. One for a fan. One for a separate light fixture.

Behind the switch cover the switches were wired as such:

Red white black on line
White black on load

The three whites (one for fan, one for light, one for line) were twisted together and capped with a wire nut. These wires were not attached to the switches but shoved in to the back of the box.

The black wires were ran as normal.

The red wire was ran as a jumper between the switches where I assume the white wires would normally get ran.

I purchased a GFCI switch/outlet combo because there were no outlets in bathroom.

I followed the instructions that came with the outlet but something went wonky and I believe it has to do with the red wire. I figured since I wasn’t using two outlets anymore I wouldn’t need to jump but alas I was wrong.

So when I turn on the switch the fan comes on but the light doesn’t. When I turn off the switch my heating and ac lose power (nest thermostat yells at me to let me know I lost power).

I’m pretty positive it has to do with this one red wire that I capped off. So how do I wire in this red one?

ndevmq,What am I getting myself into? Please help.,"So I have an opportunity of a lifetime, in my eyes anyway. I am taking over a previous hoarder house for next to nothing. A lot of work is involved, but I have the time to do any work, and from the start I know it's a lot of work, like A LOT, but it's a commitment over the next few years to get the house back in tip-top shape.

The details: 

* Built in 1987, 1900 square feet. 4 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms. Bought 25+ years ago for 135k - 1 previous owner, and current assessed value is well above 300k. We have about 70-90k to fix everything up, ideally we'd like to go under that, but we plan on doing a lot of the grunt work ourselves, since we see this as a multi-year long process.

* The house is in ok condition, except for the amount of garbage inside. That itself will take us many months of weekend work to get done. Multiple issues throughout the house I'll expand on down below.

The issues

* Living room - electrical issues on one side of the house, and replacing windows. 

* Kitchen - completely gutting and replacing everything, from cabinets to appliances to flooring. Replacing bay windows facing the backyard. 

* Garage - Garage door needs to be replaced, otherwise everything else in here is fine. Hot water heater is fine. 

* Full bathrooms - completely gutting, replacing bath/shower, toilets, sinks, cabinets, flooring. 

* Half bathroom - completely gutting, replacing toilets, sinks, flooring. 

* The bedrooms - new flooring, some drywall issues. New fixtures in all. 

* The Sunroom - new siding, new flooring, painting.

* Front deck - New planks, painting

Basically we are gutting the entire house, and repainting and putting new flooring down for every room except the hallways since those are good hardwood so we're going to sand / refinish those. Almost need all new windows, and if I remember correctly, would be 13 windows of varying sizes. It's a fuckton of grunt work, and we plan on doing everything except plumping, electrical, and possibly windows. Realistically we know we're in the long haul.

The main question is, where do we start? Are there any good Youtubers / videos I should watch on shit like flooring, cabinets, drywall repair, the whole 9 yards?",9,2,HomeImprovement,2200

There is a 4 ft retaining wall 110ft in length that runs a border of the property, that also is on a public utilities easement of 5ft on both sides of the property line (power lines). The wall is failing and will topple over at some point, bringing 2 neighbors yards into ours. We can’t find any permits for the walls when looking at records for the 3 property’s that border the wall, it’s very well that these were never up to code. Estimated cost to fix this wall is 30-50k+, neighbors have no interest in contributing, say it’s not their wall. The retaining wall appears to be built at two different times, different materials and the wall differed where the two neighbors property lines start, which makes me think the builders of the neighbors properties erected the wall. To make it even more tricky, the main contribution to the walls failure is a tree that is in the neighbors yard on the utilities easement pushing the wall over. The neighbors are not the original builders. I’m trying to consider options in the case the sellers do not fix it or offer us credit back to fix it ourselves. 

How do I determine who the wall belongs to? It appears to be on the property line.

How do I find the rules regarding building on the easement? 

Is there any legal recourse against the utilities company since the walls on their easement with the 3 properties?

Can I force the city to get involved and force them to address the issue?

Our current contractor wants to put the tiles directly on the wood (I think it's cedar but it's a guess based on smell) but another person we talked to said, they should put drywall up first because wood will eventually get problems with tile on it.

We are finally ready for a kitchen update as our granite is cracking, we don't have enough counter space, we don't have a hood (and cook a ton), we don't have enough space to entertain, and we HATE the floor.

I am wanting it to more or less be a vented pipe coming up, with a P trap. Similar to a washing machine drain, but lower so that I can get siphon force. 

However, I can find no information on suggested pipe dimensions, much less codes for something like this. Will having such a strange drain in the house likely make the house not up to codes, or since it is for something that is not specified in codes should I be okay?

ndb1kg,Home Insulation Project COMPLETED,"I have seen this posted a couple times, but my husband and I finally completed our biggest project yet, reinsulating our house. We had been waiting to do this for a while as our 1983 built house was just not insulated enough.  The house would fluctuate wildly. We received a home energy audit the first year we lived in the house and we were told that new windows/doors and air sealing the attic and blowing in more insulation would make a huge difference for us. We were very leaky, and the estimated R value in the attic was R-16. So that is what we have set out to work on this year.

First off, going into this project we knew that we needed to finish some on the ground stuff first. So in leading up to this, we had about 30 new cans lights put in, replaced our ceiling fans and put in bracers, did some updates to our HVAC system, vented our microwave vent hood to the roof, got our bathroom vent fans properly hooked up and got the three attic fans up and properly running. This is all stuff we largely did with the old insulation being there. We wanted all of this done so we didn't have to disturb our new insulation later. 

Next up, building the insulation removal machine. We thought we were going to rent a professional machine and we thought about hiring it out. However, we found some youtube videos on people building one with a 2 HP dust collector, which Harbor Freight sells for $209.99 and 3"" corrugated solid drain pipe, so that's what we did. It took us a few weeks to get the machine in and an evening to put it all together.  Amazon sells insulation removal bags made by a brand named Rhino, so we bought 15 of those.

Now for insulation sucking time! This really was the worst part of the project for us. It took us 8 days of work spread over 3 weeks pulling the insulation out. There was bird nests, and mice droppings and other critter crap. Some of the spaces were really tight to get into. It was dusty, hot and gross. And the worst part was that our roof at some point formerly had been a cedar shake roof, and there was a ton of debris that kept clogging our line. Lots of frustration, but we filled every single bag we bought and dumped roughly 1200 pounds of old insulation.

Next was fixing all electrical issues that were now exposed in our empty attic. This took the husband a few days of crawling around. Luckily it wasn't too much because he had been updating this stuff over the last couple years. 

Installing baffles and airsealing was the last steps before blowing. We installed plastic ventilation baffles for all of the soffits which were now outfitted with metal soffit cover to keep critters out. This was rough due to needing to get deep into the side. A hammer tacker made it much easier. We tried the foam ones but they were too flimsy in the tight space and nails from the roof wanted to break them. We used a great stuff pro series gaps and crack foam with the foam gun to air seal all of the top plates, around our HVAC return (which we found had been installed very crappily by our HVAC guys and was pulling a ton of air from the attic). We put in Tenmat recessed can insulation covers over every recessed can and foam sealed. This was another 3 days or so of work.

FINALLY FOR THE NEW STUFF! We bought 50 bags of insulation, this was enough to bring the 2100 feet we were insulating up to an R49 according to Owens Corning attic cat site. Machine rental was free from home depot. They screwed up on our delivery 3 weeks in a row so we were able to get a 2nd day of rental for free, which is what we needed. This whole project is really a 2 man gig, but here most of all. My husband was in the garage and I was on loading.  1/3 of the bale of insulation went in about every 2 minutes. We got to a point were we were blowing in a bag every 8 minutes.  Dealing with some hot days, this also turned into a 2 day ordeal.

BREAKDOWN ON COSTS

* $200 Insulation bags
* $210 Insulation machine
* $150 Piping
* $50 baffles
* $250 Spray foam and gun
* $450 Tenmat recessed light cover
* $1400 Insulation
* $100 random stuff (tyvek suits, gloves, walkie talkies - which were clutch when dealing with issues)

TOTAL: $2810

There is probably some costs I am missing, and this is really rough, but this is most of the big stuff.  

In referencing how this would have cost had we had a pro do it. Our neighbor just had the insulation removed from her house due to a house fire while we were doing ours. They paid $3100 for removal only. His professional machine clogging is how I now know that both our houses used to be cedar shake roofs. We had received a quote a while back to just insulate, and it was $2400ish. So despite the hard work, we definitely saved money doing it ourselves.

Did it work? We have noticed a huge difference already.  For the first time ever, every temp sensor in our house is reading the same temperature. We had a 90 degree day yesterday and I was able to get the house down to 68! Which is not a temp we keep it at, but it was nice. 

 Will we do it again? Looking back on it, I would have paid the pro to suck it all out. We will never ever ever do that again. I'm glad we did it once, but we wont do it again. The other stuff wasn't terrible, just hard work and I wish we had started sooner in the year so capture some better temperature days.

nd9uv1,"Concrete slab poured in a shed on a slope, slab is not level. What should I do?","I had a slab poured in a 18x20 shed this week. The company doing the work seems reputable and we're friendly and professional throughout the process. When we had our initial discussion they asked if they could use a 2x4 that is on the perimeter of the shed that the previous owner used to screw the metal siding to. I said of course as that's both where I assumed it would go to and knew it would cause much more work otherwise but I also ensured I asked about the dirt work that would be needed as the dirt floor of the shed before was out of level by 4 inches by my estimation and they ensured me they would be able to do it. 

On the day of the pour they showed up with a small backhoe on a trailer and got to work with shovels before the concrete trucks showed up but they never pulled the back hoe out. I assumed they were knew what they were doing and were able to level out the floor before pouring. When I was able to walk on the concrete I noticed it came up to the 2x4s along the floor exactly but it didn't look or feel level. I pulled out my level and a 12 ft 2x4 and found the slab has about a 3 inch drop across the 18ft width of the shed.

When looking at the shed I realize that the entire structure has this issue as it looks like the original builder had 16ft pipes and dug 4ft holes to drop the pipes into (pole barn construction) but didn't account for the slope. So the slab is level to the building but not truly level. I intend to use this shed as a workshop and don't know how much this will affect my work but I assume it would heavily. 

So I guess my question is what can/should be done as far as getting it fixed or if the issue is even that big of an issue for my intended use?

I added up all the payments that I made in 2020 and subtracted the amount shown on my tax form as interest paid* and it came out with a positive number for the first time ever!! It was only a few hundred dollars but at least it's something!

I've been paying for 8 years, with steadily increasing income. So I am finally paying off approximately the amount I originally borrowed (give or take). I also have been making payments during the pandemic because I wanted to take advantage of $0 interest.

My realization in all of this is that even if you take the path expected of you: go to college, graduate, get a good entry level job, slowly work up to making more and use the tools the government gives you to help you afford your payments (IBR), the government will make out like a bandit and you'll be over here being excited to find out  that you've just given the government nearly $40k in interest before you started actually making a dent in the amount you originally borrowed and that was only possible because of a global pandemic.

ndfjvo,Help Understanding Federal Loans?,"): Hello, I'm very confused on taking out loans still... I'm a rising junior but just transferred college for my major (trying to get better job prospects) and am being forced to start out as a freshman. I don't feel like I understand the amount of debt I'll be in when I graduate. Here's everything:

Major: Industrial Design

Class status: Freshman with sophomore standing (so 2nd year aid level for fed loans)

Current loans out: 11k in federal loans

Price of college/yr: \~13k

It'll take me 4 years to graduate now. A relative said they will 100% pay for my first two years at my new school, which I am insanely grateful for. Additionally, I am planning to get a job on campus, and appeal my aid by 4k (max) each year.

I think my total debt would be: (13 x 2 ) + 11 = 48k.

Is that correct? Is there something I'm missing? If I start out as a freshman in my class standing, will be 11k in fed loans go up each year? As such, will the 11 in my total debt calculation be different? Do I ever hit the max on those loans? ):

I'm sorry I don't understand anything. I'm a first gen college student with parents who do not wish to really help me at all. I made my college change for better job prospects, but I'm worried my debt will be too much, especially if I calculated my federal sub/unsub loans wrong.",2,3,StudentLoans,1308
ndg8da,Tuition went to collections and appeal was denied even though my father was hospitalized and grandfather died of covid during last spring semester,Serious question: I’ve been working on credit for quite awhile and finally had over 700 and wa steady to refinance my cap one loan. Last spring when covid closed the world down I was enrolled in 4 classes with the local community college. I had FA which I was told would cover the cost. I was hospitalized with covid and my grandfather passed in March and may time frame. Needless to say I didn’t finish class. I also never technically withdrew since I thought it would be automatic and I spoke to the school in Augusta September timeframe and they told me to file an appeal when possible and it would forgive the $1590 they say I owed. I received a collection letter in January and wrote a letter to st Pete college and said that wasn’t my debt. A lady called me and I again explained the situation. She told me to file Appeal when I could so that I could register for spring semester 2021. I filed the appeal in March and submitted documents from hospital and my grandfather obituary (he passed of covid) and my appeal was instantly (the next day) denied because they said it was too difficult to pull up last years records and basically an accounting nightmare. I replied and asked to speak to dean. They continued to email me back once every 4 weeks to tell me yes it is indeed denied because I could only file an appeal with 60 days of end of semester. This wouldn’t have been possible as I was as caring for my dad and grandmother plus the previous lady told me not to worry and just do it before I enrolled again. Now I see that wyndam collections has put a $1600 bill on my credit reports resulting in 30 point loss. I also received a letter from Navient that my student loans were forgiven for last spring semester. So really I shouldn’t owe them anything at all. Death and covid hospitalization with evidence should be adequate grounds for appeal but they keep saying no and just response from business office or “accounting specialist” and won’t allow me to speak to dean. I feel helpless and that all my hard work has gone to waste. I can’t afford to pay for an entire semester of school that I didn’t attend. I was only able to go to school because of financial aid and which was valid and should’ve covered the tuition. I feel like I’m being deceived and don’t know what to do.

ndbvby,Fishy ex in-laws?,"Tl;dr at bottom

Apologies if this is a no-brainer in either direction. I was fortunate enough to avoid student loans, so I’m not too sure about the ins and outs of what’s legal, and googling has only been marginally helpful.

Mine and my ex spouse’s divorce was largely precipitated by both him and his parents having NO sense of boundaries; they constantly meddled and he constantly let them. 

It’s been years, and I’ve more than moved on, but I’m still working through the very traumatic way it happened (they cut his hair, threw out his clothes, changed his number, and had his brother move from 5h away to live in the same new apartment complex they setup for him). 

Part of that has been trying to sort through what’s normal and what’s problematic. One thing that always stuck out to me was that: one day, he casually - but with a bit of scoffing and mentioning it was a little weird - told me that a few years prior they had used his student loan money for a trip. But like...they became progressively more wealthy since we’d met, going from small town stable to likely millionaires. So, it never became a “problem” because they not only paid him back, but also ended up completely paying off $40k in his student loans about a year after we got married.

It stuck out to me as weird, possibly illegal, and probably unethical. I think I’ve had a hard time wrapping my mind around it because 1) he didn’t suffer because of it, 2) it’s such a specific situation, and 3) my own parents would _literally never in a billion years have asked that of me._ Tbh it has me questioning what other shady stuff his dad may have done with his business, for example.

So: parents using their kids’ student loan money but then paying it back: is that illegal? Is it fraud? Have any of you experienced anything like that? What would you do or say if your own parents propositioned you to do this?

The other school I got accepted into, DAAP, has the best ID program in the U.S. and it comes with 5 semesters of co-op built into the curriculum, and has tons of industry connections. It's definitely my dream school... but it also costs 110k. That's as low as I can get it from them.

The ID industry is super competitive, which is why I'd like to go to DAAP. The alumni network and having up to 5 internships before I even graduate would give me a huge edge over students from other schools who probably only had 1 or 2 if any.

nda4e3,Co-signer wants to be released from student loan and i'm drowning in debt due to medical leave from school. I have no clue what to do.,"Tldr: I took a year off of school to focus on my mental health and now I have no deferment period on my student loans despite JUST graduating.  I do not have a job, and loan providers will not give me COVID relief forbearance or hardship forbearance and I cannot afford my payments, my co-signer wants to be released, and I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  

I have three student loan providers. 1 through Sallie Mae, 1 through Discover Student Loans, and my federal loans are all combined in one payment. Federal loans are temporarily suspended due to the president's executive order however I am still expected to make full payments with Sallie Mae ($225 p/month) and Discover ($175 p/month).

When I was a senior in college I wound up taking a leave of absence to focus on my mental health. During those times I wasn't a full-time student and my student loan providers said I used up all of my deferment periods and I had to start paying back my loans in full. I informed them that I was not able to work at the time and I didn't know what to do because I didn't want to fall delinquent on my loans. They said my only option was to go back to school full time (which I wasn't ready to do yet) in order to stop payments. 

I went back to school part-time in Fall 2019 and used a hardship forbearance for the semester on my two private loans, I worked full time to pay for housing and make payments on my federal loans. I went back to school full time in Spring 2020 and my payments were stopped.  I had to take two more classes the following semester (Fall 2020) to graduate and that is considered part-time status so I went back into repayment however because of COVID I was given three months of pandemic relief forbearance from August-November 2020. I went back to work in August 2020 but was only given part-time hours. I never received UI and in Feb 2021 I could no longer afford to make payments on my loans AND pay my rent so I had to move back in with my mother however I lost accessibility to my job and had to quit that too. I'm still unemployed at this time and seeking full-time work, but nothing yet sadly. 

My two private loans are co-signed by my godmother/aunt (father's side) however I've been disowned by that side of my family and she no longer wants anything to do with me or my student loans and has been harassing me to release her as a cosigner. I am not able to release her though for a number of reasons like using a hardship forbearance during Fall 2019 and still not having a job. 

I don't know what else to do or who to ask for help. I am now 2 months delinquent on my Discover student loan and my godmother is really angry because it's affecting her credit score and she's trying to buy a home. Even though she is the co-signer she will not make payments and has made it clear that I need to take care of this.

2. The concrete around the toilet flange is pitted, and not flat with the rest of the floor. There wasn't any apparent sign of leakage, so I think the seal is fine, but as long as I have it ripped apart is it worth it to patch the depression, or does it not matter much since the newly installed toilet and flooring will cover over it?
3. As you can see in the photos, there's a pretty significant amount of drywall crumbling at the base around about half of the bathroom. Can I just cut away the first couple feet of drywall and replace it, or is it a good idea to just rip out the walls to the studs and start fresh ?

We're in Canada. Neither of our neighbours are willing to split the cost and it doesn't sound like that is going to change anytime soon. We want the fence for privacy and aesthetics. We have no plans to get a dog anytime soon. We could go ahead with one portion and complete other portions later.

There is a portion along the alley where there is no existing fence that we will go ahead with regardless.

Our inspector noted that we have a newer electrical panel, but that there is no ground rod. And that as it is newer it should be grounded, but isn’t. Our home was built in the 1950s and it currently has 2 prong outlets as well as some 3 prong outlets. I don’t know much about electricity, but I did check the 3 prong outlets (took face plate off and checked) and they seem to have a ground wire. Does anyone know what this could mean? Does the ground wire just not lead anywhere?

That being said, it's not the cheapest sink or counter on the market, so if it needs to change then I'd like to bring it up sooner rather than later with the contractor. Is this issue worth bringing up? I'm assuming the countertop would have to be completely replaced, and I wouldn't want to pay for the second one. I never talked to the contractor about under or top mounting the sink. There is also a drinking water filtration system under the sink which doesn't leave much room for moving things around.

Edit:  A couple more facts:  

* it was purchased recently but returning it for a warranty isn't an option because it's been tiled in.  
* the contractor who installed it removed the supporting styrofoam block so it flexed and theres a belly where water sits.  This may have also resulted in some micro cracks too.  
* When my friend was installing the tile, he was wearing boots that had dirt on it and this scratched the enamel a bit.   I believe this is why the bottom feels rougher than the sides.

The existing sill sat on a flag stone foundation, and obviously shows some signs of rot in places from the last 120 years. My house is currently jacked up 4’ in the air and sitting on cribbing. I have hired a guy to excavate and pour my new basement walls and floor. I am doing everything else, including building two new additions on the house (which will have basement underneath them). I am an avid DIY guy, and am trying to figure out the best way to attach my existing home to the new foundation. Here are the images of what it looks like prior to excavation. https://imgur.com/gallery/MIhvQOX 

I know that I need to attach a pressure treated sill to the top of the concrete foundation. I believe I have a few options: 1) attach my sill plate to the foundation and then use metal straps to attach the existing timber to the new sill plate when they set the house back down. 2) I could do the same as above, but also attach another board to the timber using long 6-8” screws and then set the house down. This way I can more easily cut out any rotten spots and fill them in. This would give me a double bottom plate for my sill. This would probably be best, but lumber prices are horrible right now. 3) I could attach my pressure treated sill plate directly to my existing timber and then set it down on my foam on top of the concrete foundation. This is what the guy who lifted the house said to do, but I don’t see how to attach the sill to the concrete.

Two options we're considering:

2. Removing the entire railing and spindles, putting down a strip of oak and installing a new railing.

[Here is a picture of the fixture](https://imgur.com/gallery/hPU3U2w)

Firstly, I believe Black A to be my hot wire as I first tried wiring as follows:

- Black A to Black (light)
- White A to White (light)
- Ground A to Ground (light).

This resulted in the light being lit at full brightness when the breaker was turned back on but it was not controlled by the switch.

From reading various help posts elsewhere, my understanding is that the following arrangement should have it work with the switch:

- Black A to White B
- Black B to Black (light)
- White A to White (light)

When I flip the breaker back on though, this results in the light being dimly lit and still not affected by the switch. 

Is there something I'm doing wrong with the ground wires that might be the source of my issue? I didn't think they should affect anything but that's about the only variable I haven't messed with at this point. There is a ground that comes from the B wire that is attached to the fixture (not the new bulb but the fixture that's inset in the ceiling in the pic) by a screw.

Can anyone shed some light on what I might be doing wrong?

ndznpg,Bathroom shower tile lifted.,"First post here, I am from the UK :)

Today when removing some tile grout whitener the wife had used to make the grout look a bit whiter she noticed a tile was slightly out of position. I managed to get the entire tile out intact. I simply cut around the grout and was about to break the tile to remove it when I tried prying it and to my surprise it just lifted out.

The adhesive had previously been put on what looks like a cement backing board, but there has been slight water ingress and it looks like the backing just rotted and the tile lifted. The odd thing is after testing all the other tiles they all seem totally secure and not wanting to move. I now have a tile so clean that it looks like it came out of a box so can reinstall the original tile. My question is. How? Obviously, I can't just put adhesive straight onto that cement and all the other tiles have still adhered to the original surface. For the moment a new bathroom is not financially viable so I am asking what I can do to reinstall this tile into that gap, do I need a membrane here or can I use an adhesive straight onto that cement. I was thinking of using a small piece of kerdi just to give the tile some extra waterproofing (this may be overkill for such a small job?)

When my partner and I moved in, we had an electric fireplace with a very cheap surround. We have got rid of the surround, and there is a small hole that leads up to the chimney. Annoyingly, the hole is too small to fit anything in there, so ideally we would like to block it up and just put an electric wood burner in front of a blank wall. 

We live in a three storey, very old, cottage. We have done our research and realised that we will need to put a ventilation grate in the wall when blocking it up, so as not to get damp.

My question is: do we also need to cap off the chimney if we have the ventilation grate? Just to reiterate: we live in a very skinny, three storey cottage - we can't even see the roof from the street! - so getting up there is going to be difficult.

ne6708,100 year old cast-iron sewer line failing?,"My mom’s house was built in the mid-20s and over the weekend the basement toilet started backing up. Had to go with Roto-Rooter for the emergency service and clear out. They scoped the pipe and it was pretty corroded on the inside. They suggested a reline for about $18,000 (which I think that price also included i stalling a new outdoor clean out right where the sewer line exits the house). The problem is the house is set back from the street at over 100 feet and the sewer line runs down to city service under a concrete drive way and is probably about 15 feet deep at the end of the driveway, so it really isn’t a DIY job to drop a PVC line in there.

ne5a7x,Could gunk in the flexible copper pipe connected to my water heater cause a leak in the cold water supply line because of too much pressure?,"I just moved into a new house and was planning on draining the water heater this weekend because it's periodically making knocking noises, which I understand to be the result of sediment. Upon going to turn off the cold water line, I noticed two pinhole leaks coming from the final CPVC coupling that was connected to the flexible copper pipe that ultimately connects to the water heater. I therefore replaced this coupling with a shark bite connector. One end of the SharkBite screws into the copper pipe, the other end is connected to the 3/4"" CPVC pipe. However, the end that is screwed into the copper pipe has a verrrry slow leak:

http://imgur.com/gallery/pVJhovm

I noticed when doing this repair that the copper pipe has a lot of gunk in it. Could that be increasing the pressure enough at the connection point to cause this leak? I'm happy to buy a replacement, or perhaps going forward with draining the water heater will actually cause that to get flushed out? Seems unlikely.

In the process of cleaning up the place, we found a lot of standing water in the crawl space and around the concrete foundation. I immediately started improving the drainage and things are much dryer. There are some cracks in the foundation and corresponding cracks in the drywall along the downhill side. We called two different large foundation stabilization companies to get quotes. Both found that one corner of the house is quite low... As much as 2.5 inches. TerraFirma proposed to install 11 piles at a cost of $27,500 or $2500 per pile. RamJack proposed to install 8 piles at a cost of $18,460 or $1995 per pile. (Both after the cost of permits and engineering).

One difference is that TerraFirma proposed to stabilize the second, slightly less settled corner of the house. While RamJack focused on the chimney, which I don't think TerraFirma even looked at. We didn't get to drill down on the differences with the RamJack rep because he was a lot more rushed, maybe because he knew it was our second quote, and maybe also because I, the male partner, wasn't there to engage with him.

Anyway. We are trying to decide which direction to go. It seems to me that these sales reps are shooting from the hip.

I am renovating my kitchen. I have a designer but she does not consult on appliances. I’ve picked my fridge, dishwasher and range, but I’m awash in doubt about a good as I’ve never had a gas stove.

The design calls for a wall mounted, vented range hood. My burners total 5,000 BTU so I know I need 500 CFM or more. I’ve also determined baffle filters are easier to clean than mesh filters. I’ve considered all of this in selecting my five options.

Some are brands available at the main big box stores. Others are only available on Amazon but have been recommended on review websites. Of course, I am a little skeptical of those because I know some of those places get a cut of sales for referrals.

I’m including just brand names and CFM rather than model numbers to keep things simple. They range in price from $350-$700.

*Kobe 750 CFM

*Kucht 900 CFM

*Z Line 500 CFM
(Not sure of warrantee)
(Some reputable sites recommend this brand but most of their products are 400 CFM. I found only one that’s 500 CFM, so I wonder if this brand is better suited foe electric stoves.)

*iKitch 900 CFM

There's one register in the living room/kitchen, one register in the bedroom, and one register in the bathroom, all ceiling.  The guts of the system are installed in the ceiling in the bathroom, so that's where everything originates from.  The total duct distance from the guts of the system to the register in the bedroom is probably 20', if that.  It's a small apartment.  The total sqft is probably around 700sqft and the bedroom is around 16'x12', so around \~200sqft.  Hardwood floors throughout, ceiling height the same. 

Anyway.  Our bedroom gets SO HOT, compared to the rest of the apartment, and it's driving me crazy because I can't figure out why.  The air coming out of the register is cold and strong, just like in the rest of the apartment, but the temperature difference between the two rooms is dramatic.  Walking out into the living room is like walking into a refrigerator, whereas we struggle with sweating while we sleep in the bedroom.  

It's to the point where we keep taking the thermostat lower and lower, and then our AC system ices over and stops blowing, so we have to turn it off for a day to let it thaw, and we keep repeating that cycle.  In Washington DC the summers are HOT and HUMID, and it's only now getting hot enough to run the AC, but it's only going to get worse as we move into summer. 

We have a desk/office space in the bedroom as well as a TV, but these are all turned off at night (and not generating heat).  We have vinyl shades over the windows to keep the lights out at night and generally those partially attached during the day.

neld1s,Porch Swing Mounting Advice,"Hello all -

I've had a porch swing for the past year that I mounted under our covered porch using Eyehooks (like in [this image](https://diy.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/diy/fullset/2016/5/24/0/Original_Flynnside-Out-hanging-porch-swing-step-3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.1280.960.suffix/1464132589342.jpeg)). Well today, one of the eye hooks sheared off during use - right where the metal met the wood. It seems that the back-and-forth lateral load caused stress on the bolt and it weakened. Maybe a crappy eyebolt? Maybe my kids and I swung a little hard on it *(hey it's fun!)*? 

I'm looking for advice on how ELSE I can hang a porch swing using two points in the roof beams of the porch. Is there some sort of metal bracing I can attach to the beams that would better resist lateral loads? 

Or maybe I should have screwed in the eyebolts directly flush to the wood? I believe I left a little of the eyebolt out of the wood, which in hindsight, probably allowed the lateral load to apply directly to the bolt.

Just trying to figure out the best way to mount this again so it doesn't shear again!

I live in the Midwest and within three miles of a HomeDepot. So thankful for this as this project resulted in countless trips. 

I bought a Fiskars ($18) machete from Home Depot and chopped off the top layer of Ivy. Then I sprayed Bio Advanced Brush Killer ($14) and let it soak.

Stuffed every root and Ivy vine in a 30gal garden bag (about 60 total at $36). 
Layed fresh dirt and Kentucky blue grass (roughly $120). After all roots were removed from area closest to house, I layed weed barrier and brick to make a wall and board. About $200 in total. Then dumped 20 bags of red mulch to fill in at about $60 total.

We are struggling to find anything to use on top of the fence for a privacy screen. My husband's idea was to buy long rectangular plywood with a brick pattern on it and lean it against the fence providing about 2 feet of extra privacy on top. Im worried the plywood will just fall down when the wind picks up. As such I suggested we move them to the alley so we only see the top 2 feet privacy part. Then string them together and put steaks in the ground to hold them up. Possibly with a string going from a hole in the top to the otherside of the fence (into out yard) to counter balance it.
Just wondering if anyone has some ideas on a better solution. We can still return the plywood.

Problems:
1) I don't think the plywood will last and all the sheets together cost almost $500.
2) Buying the steaks and string will cost even more $$
3) Might look ugly with the strings going from the plywood to the steak in the ground.
4) might rub against the fence and scratch it.

neg5vs,Leaking water heater (bottom of tank) only 5 years old,"I feel like I see water in my sleep now. We moved into our (old.) house three weeks ago and have been fixing some plumbing issues. The plumbers used my water heater to unclog a stack with high pressure water. It left a lot of water on the floor from when they opened the pipe clean out, and they cleaned up as best as they could. The next morning I went down and saw some water around the bottom of the tank. Thought maybe it was residual water. Cleaned it up and all good. Well, she seems to be leaking because there’s a small pool of water whenever we use hot water in the shower or washing machine. Photo attached. No issues with hot water at all; the leak seems to be coming from the bottom on the side, away from the valves. 

I am curious how long I can leave this leak without it becoming a much larger leak, based off of your experience if you have it. Also the timing of the leak seems...odd...you know, the day after they used it, but I’m not sure how it can be related.  It’s a 50 gallon tank that is only 5 years old, so I’m quite surprised it is leaking at all. No service records written on the log sheet, only the install date. Tank replacement is not an expense I really want to deal with right now because I have a big electrical and AC job coming up, and more plumbing. It’s in an unfinished basement so I don’t have immediate major water damage concerns, either.

The issue I have now is that after having shut the valves on the pressure vacuum breaker to off and turning on the water, a small amount of water dribbles out from the cap.  Does this mean there's a leak in the pressure vacuum breaker or did I do something bad by first having tried to turn on the water while the valves on the breaker were in the 45 deg position? The entire system (and house) is two years old.

Here's a video of the water leak: [https://imgur.com/gallery/bH7DpMB](https://imgur.com/gallery/bH7DpMB)

FYI, it looks like in the video that the bottom valve is not completely closed but it doesn't turn any further than this.

Thanks!

EDIT:  I opened the cap and it turns out the white plastic piece was shattered. I'll try to get a new one at the hardware store. Hopefully that'll do the trick!

neftnh,Flickering Lights with No Resolution,"We are getting desperate and frustrated at this point, hoping for ideas. Posted on r/askanelectrician and trying here as well. 

My parents had a 3-day power outage back in August 2020. Ever since then, half of the lights in their home start to flicker at weird hours, for hours on end. This is a noticeable and distracting flickering and their house seems to be the only one affected. It happens more towards the night but is not exclusive to that. 

We've had our local Electric Company go there multiple times and they've replaced the transformer, connections, wires, tightened things up, you name it. Every time they do, we get about 1-3 weeks of relief before it starts again. Eventually they said there was nothing else they could fix and it must be internal.

Our local electrician (that I used for my own house and they did a great job) went around testing a few things and said it would be best to just replace the whole service from the very top all the way to the box; just get rid of all of the variables of bad breakers, bus bars, and start fresh. A few days later it started again.

They came back and they've tested the lights having the issue and nothing is coming up. Everything looks tight and well connected. They tested breakers for load and shared neutrals and again nothing of notice. They are now in the process of installing a voltage recorder at the meter to see if they can find a voltage drop from the outside to see if it really is our house. 

Last night I used my own voltage meter at several outlets that were causing the problem with lamps, during the time of the flickering, and I saw nothing on my end. Just a steady 124-125v while staring at a flickering light.

If the electricians find no voltage drops at the meter, what do we do next? I feel like we are running out of ideas and are looking for some kind of ""ah ha!"" moment. Are we missing something obvious? Anyone have any ideas?",13,5,HomeImprovement,1920
nefq8y,Can a laundry machine use the existing drainage pipes from an existing bathroom in a basement?,"Couldn't find a clear answer. But basically putting together plans for a pre-construction home, and the builder is offering rough-ins for a 3p bathroom in the basement for ~$900 CAD and a laundry rough-in in the basement for ~$1600.

Thinking to just do the bathroom rough-ins only, and in the future, when I plan to finish the basement, just plan for the laundry room back-to-back with the bathroom to use existing piping. I understand the laundry facilities will also require a 240V outlet as well as ventilation to outside from the dryer, but not sure if these costs would exceed paying $1600 to do the rough-ins, or if a third party contractor can do it later at a much lower cost?

Would it be more prudent to just do the 3p bathroom only and leave out the laundry rough-ins?

nen1wp,Can someone explain early payoff?,"I’m snowballing my loans through Nelnet right now. Instead of actually making payments during the deferment, I’m putting my monthly payments aside in a savings account with the intent to drop it all in when deferral ends. That said, I’m tracking the payments in a snowball system, putting all the money to the lowest loan group first, then second lowest, etc.

So here’s my question, and I’m going to use an example to clarify.

Say I have a total balance of $60,000 and owe $800 a month total, covering 8 loan groups.

The monthly payment for each group is $100.

Here’s the question: If I pay off Group A, will my monthly payment become $700 a month, or will Nelnet still charge $800 a month and just allocate the $100 that’s been going toward Group A to all the other groups?

I’m hoping paying off one or two of the loans will lower my overall monthly payment when the deferral ends, but I read somewhere that your monthly payment stays the same until everything is paid off, even if you pay off one or more of the individual groups.

I had original plans to build walls under 4' and spaced >6' apart but was talked into a ~5.5' wall moved further back which gave me more usable space. Unfortunately permitting is not the problem I'm worried about, but that is a different problem.

The thing I'm worried about is that the wall does not have proper drainage in my opinion. There's about 2"" of 57 stone mixed with crushed rock serving as foundation on top of packed, dense Georgia clay. For those unfamiliar, clay does not drain well or... really at all. Besides this there is 57 in the cavities of the blocks themselves but no backfill behind the wall besides what spilled over from shoveling. Now I know this is incorrect construction and though there is not much stress on this wall, I'm worried about drainage. Damage is done for the project and I don't expect my contractor to help with any code updates considering he skipped a permit. 

My question is if it's feasible to dig out behind the wall and backfill with gravel. The clay breaks easily enough with a mattock and the rest is just shovelling.

ner2a6,New Paver Patio,"Completed a new brick paver patio project this spring! https://imgur.com/a/ys2oZkn.

Completed project = ~$1400

* Bricks + Delivery =	750
* Gravel + Sand + Delivery =	350
* Heavy landscape cloth =	70
* Play sand =	4
* Plastic Edging and stakes =	40
* 3-day compactor rental =	150
* 4-hr concrete saw rental =	55

First time building a patio so I ended up watching a lot of different youtube videos and read a few blogs from other DIY folks out there.  The steps are all pretty straightforward.  Essentially you need under a paver 4-6"" of compacted base + 1"" of sand and you need to ensure a 1.5 - 2% roll off for water.  From there, it's all in the execution.  

1. Cleared the site + 3"" on the open edges for the plastic edging to be staked in
2. Set stakes in all 4 corners and ensure you're square
3. (Set the lines)  There are different ways to do this but I found the low point, make the line level, then increase the high side by the amount needed to reach 2% roll-off.  
4. Repeat and double, triple check
5. Measure under the lines and ensure the ground itself is even as possible w/o any organic matter like roots in it
6. Run a compactor over the dirt to eliminate any air pockets made from digging
7. Lay down ground cloth
8. Fill in your gravel base and compact.  I didn't have a super heavy compactor so I filled and compacted in 2 layers
9. Check your gravel for slope.  I used a straight 2x4 with and taped an offset to it that signified the slope I should achieve. If I placed a level on top of the 2x4 and it was flat then I knew my roll-off was correct.  I went over the whole surface fanning out from the house/sunroom corner 
10. Drop down some .75"" pvc and screeded sand.  **""Why did you use .75 inch pvc when you said 1"" of sand?""**  Don't forget most pipes are sold by their inner diameter! If I used a 1"" pvc, there would've been too much sand
11. After screeding, start dropping in pavers
12. After all the bricks are in, stake down the edging, and run the compactor over it
13. Sweep in some play sand and call it a day

Hopefully that's enough detail! Let me know if you have any questions about the process.  Lastly, a **big** help for me to keep the costs down was to use 2nds from the brick supplier.  They had a whole yard full of returns or mistints so I was able to get the pavers for a dramatically cheaper price.  Instead of $5.50 per sq ft, I got it for $1.10.

Had envelope inspectors come out because can someone just tell me what’s wrong, and they said it’s the windows, plus a few other things. They said all windows need to be resealed around edges and screws, the cracks need to be sealed, and we are missing mullion on two windows. They also noticed that there needs to be some sealing between the roof and stucco, and part of our roof flashing isn’t long enough.

Sounds like an easy fix, but we have evidence of existing leaks around most windows, and we learned not to trust the prior owners work. There’s evidence of old patching around a few windows. Also, our baseboards were recently replaced which is now a red flag instead of a selling point...

My question is: who would you call? Contractor? Handyman? Do I find separate companies? Window companies won’t touch it unless they installed the windows.",0,3,HomeImprovement,1309
neqmtf,"Tiling project, Hardiebacker meets old plaster","So the project that never ends:
Bathroom. Plaster (wood) lath walls. I'm putting Hardiebacker up to a height of 5` (one sheet) all the way around the bathroom, higher in some areas because of old damage from previous owners. Shimming the studs out so that the HB will end up as close to flush with the plaster as possible. 

[Image](https://i.imgur.com/ZQ2vypj.jpg)

So the question - Should I:

* Just cut the plaster so as to have as tight of a gap as humanly possible, then fill the gap with (thinset/render plaster/whatever)

Or

* Cut the plaster to the height of HB (black dotted line) + width of a wood lath strip + 2x the width of a speed square (red dotted line), then plaster the gap with (thinset/render plaster/whatever) to create a smooth transition?
Additional question, in either 1 or 2 above, what should I be using? Modified/unmodified thinset, rendering plaster, some other product I don't know about? And if I do, is there anything I need to do to get the product to actually stick to the old plaster?

neq7am,How to deal with gate that no longer opens/closes on new fence.,"We had a cedar shadowbox fence installed in our backyard in September. The install was delayed by 2 months due to supply issues related to COVID. After they told us about the delay, the communication from the owner and his main assistant (I believe his sister) took an absolute nose dive. I was very patient because I knew COVID was probably wreaking havoc on their business, but I would hear absolutely nothing from them unless I badgered them. They finally contacted me in September and gave me 1 day notice that they could schedule my fence install, and luckily I was able to arrange to be off work. The crew did a good job and once the fence was done I was of course happy with the product but also happy I'd never have to deal with them again.

Unfortunately, one of the gates we had installed started to no longer open/close around February, so less than 6 months after the install. It looks like one of the fence posts has sunk 3-4 inches which has caused the latch to be completely off and the door to not have room to swing freely in the frame. It did have some adjustment on the post bracket of the latch so I moved it by a half inch, but this only helped for a day and it's only gotten worse. I feel like the fence contractor should fix this, as it's been less than 6 months and the gate no longer functions, and the cost of a gate is factored into the price of the project.

I have been in contact with them, and the communication is once again abysmal. If you call their number, they state they're too busy to communicate by phone and to just email them. They've responded and say they want to fix the gate, but it has been over 2 months and they haven't arranged anything. They sent their crew to my house one morning without providing any notice, and my wife and I were both at work. It's difficult because I work in healthcare and can't usually just take off work with no notice, and with their godawful communication there's little chance they're going to actually give a scheduled time in advance. It seems like the owner and assistant simply don't talk to each other and she only responds if I continually bother her. I sent a strongly worded email 3 weeks ago and she was apologetic and claimed ""Owner asked me to keep on him and not let him forget about your gate, we promise we want to fix it"". I heard nothing for 2 weeks, emailed for an update last week and it's been crickets.

I need this gate to work, but I don't want to open it right now at all because I need it to be able to close so my dog doesn't get out. I'm worried the latch is eventually going to snap. I feel like my options at this point are to keep badgering the company and hope I get lucky that they actually act professionally and either fix it or at least go ahead and tell me to go to hell, hire another company to repair it, or fix it myself.

What actually is the fix for this problem? Is there something they would be able to do to jack the post up and align it properly again? I found that you can get a turnbuckle repair kit to fix sagging gates, but should I expect to have to install that on nearly a brand new fence? Is it simply moving the latch and/or hinges? If it's simply adjusting the latch I can do that, but how do I know the post isn't going to sink further? I'm also a bit bothered by the unevenness of it and if that's fixable I'd rather it be done right. Thanks for any advice, and if you're in the Northern Virginia area and want to know which fence contractor to avoid at all costs, just pm me.

nepz3i,Replacement windows with black exterior: vinyl or fiberglass?,"So I am looking at replacing all our windows (9 total) and two exterior doors. I would like black exteriors, and have started looking for contractors. One has told me he refuses to sell black exterior vinyl windows because of how they can flake and distort due to our Southeast climate & sun. I have read other people experiencing this as well. This made me think I had to go with fiberglass, but there are very few companies around here that install fiberglass windows. The ones that do use Marvin Infinity windows. I am skeptical of Marvin as I see they had a class action lawsuit. I also don't like the limited warranty. If I am paying a lot of money for a product, I want to make sure the basics are covered -- and it seems to me that Marvin doesn't even account for failures like premature air gaps, cracking, etc.

Should I consider black exterior vinyl windows that may be more prone to issues if the warranty is good (looking at Sunrise Windows Restoration line)? Is fiberglass better than vinyl for a black exterior despite the fact that the warranty may not be as good?

Regardless of material, I want to do this once. Considering how much windows cost, I want to be assured that if I have problems, there is a valuable warranty to assist with them -- especially considering that I am getting an exterior color that may have some issues.

1. Trees near the leach field were cut as I was informed it could mess up the grid.
2. Drain field risers were installed on all ends & each port was hydro jetted.

It's been about a year since and I noticed I am still getting lush growth of grass along the drain lines again. On top of that, I noticed lush growth at the ends of all risers.

But I have a low slope section where my lower roof meets my neighbor's unit. It used to be covered with a black sheeting material and I wanted it replaced. This morning, I found out they had no intention of touching it. I called the office and they agreed to replace it (as it was stated in the quote). The whole reason I chose these contractors was because the salesman was the only person to intelligibly address this section and say they would replace it the right way.

[Here is what they did.](https://imgur.com/a/4yshggK)

Am I crazy if I don't want to accept it the way it is? Here are my issues:

- The color. My HOA is very particular about color matching, so if they find out this section is now white they could fine me $50 a day until it's fixed. Almond versus driftwood I could get away with, but they went from black to white.

- The shingles were cut way too short. They used to go all the way to the edge of the water channel. Now they were cut 8 inches shorter for some unknown reason. And the cut seems very sloppy.

- The seams where it meets the gutter. No idea what that is or what is sealing it, but I am concerned it will fail much sooner than the rest of the roof. This is above my living room.

I called the roofer's office and at first thing they said is that they'd have someone call me to ""explain it better"". I'm not interested in an explanation, I just want it done the way I specified 4 months ago. But I also don't want to be rude - they have been good to work with so far.

nezj7g,Builder can't get out detached garage location right,"Just wanted to vent and see what people think of this. 

Doing renovations, and a big portion of the project is having the builder put up a detached garage in our rear yard. The original plan shows it meeting the 6' side yard requirement, *including* the eaves which project 18"" off the side. So the foundation sits about 2' away from the 6' sideyard, or 8' off the lot line. 

They had it staked out, and I noticed that the corner of the building was staked out 6' from the lot line. I pointed it out to to the builders on site, and they kinda hand waved and said don't worry about it, but I was concerned that the eaves were going to project 18"" into the side yard. I've heard of buildings being torn down in our area for this exact problem. 

Regardless, we had to move the structure back a few feet and change the orientation slightly, so they had it moved and re-staked and re-surveyed. Well lo and behold, the stakes are STILL 6' off the lot line, and the survey now only shows the foundation, not the eaves as the original one did. Clearly we're going to violate the setback by 18"". So I told them not to start digging until it was correct. 

Now he's giving me a decent amount of pushback. He's claiming it's my fault for not telling them where we want the building etc. I told him we just want it to be in compliance with zoning, and in response he sent me a completely incorrect zoning regulation (I basically know them by heart at this point) saying we had a 3' side yard (seriously... way off). Says ""we just build it, it's your job to tell us where"", being pretty snarky actually. He's telling me to just tell them where we want the thing as though it's somehow my indecision that's holding them up.

What's the appropriate response here? I actually want to tell them to completely fuck off and go find another builder, but not sure if that's overkill?

Through its life, have replaced the T&P valve 3 times (most recently a few months ago). I have replaced the cold water intake expansion tank once (few months ago). It’s always seemed a little odd. Have had plumber come to house recently and pressure to my house has been right about 50psi. 

What’s happening: T&P will open and leak out maybe 1-2 gallons of water, but this only seems to occur if I’m away for a weekend or longer, and the water hasn’t been used in a few days.  It maybe has happened once when I’ve been home but by and large it’s when water isn’t even being used. Plumber recommended new expansion tank and T&P which I did and still the problem persists. Once in April when I was away for 2 nights. Then last week when I was gone for a week, BUT before I left I turned the temp of the hot water heater way down.  That makes me think this is a pressure related issue.

Going forward: Only things that remain to replace are: 1) house pressure regulator or 2) whole hot water heater. My fear is I replace the hot water heater and still have the same damn problem. But on the other hand the house pressure seems correct when tested. I will say sometimes when I flush a toilet and the tank is refilling it seems like the water flow sounds different/ stronger, like a momentary higher pressure.

ney5mg,What insulation should I use?,"TLDR:  What insulation should I use to replace the R-11 fiberglass insulation we had in basement studs that are 1 inch away from a cement wall in most areas, and right up to insulating sheathing and brick in another section.?

Hi all, just looking for a little advice.  We have been living in our new home for about a year now and I noticed that a baseboard in the basement looked like it had mold growing. Sure enough when I pulled it off I found a good bit of rot and mold.  I pulled the wall apart and a lot of the insulation was a bit moldy and discolored, so I removed it all.

[https://imgur.com/9rKj9Ag](https://imgur.com/9rKj9Ag)

This is all the wall I'm going to pull apart for now, the damage doesn't seem to extend any further, and to be honest it's not too bad considering. Studs are in good shape just stained. I've already got it pretty dried out and I'm going to bleach treat the wood. I've cut the bottom of the 1980's paneling off, I'll replace just this bottom 2-3inches with similar 1980's paneling and replace/cover with new baseboard.  I think this is a better fix than trying to find a matching replacement for the whole paneling, and in a few years I would like to drywall this space, so it good enough for now.  At that time I'll redo the insulation in the whole space. I've also pretty much determined the cause, and it a combination of its-so-dumb-it's almost comical things:

The downspout for the gutter terminates at this far corner onto a cement runner that should direct water away from the house.  That runner didn't exactly fit under the downspout and so whoever put it there probably 10 years ago put it backwards and said good enough.  It literally directs water towards the house (facepalm). [https://imgur.com/D9xLDMQ](https://imgur.com/D9xLDMQ)

It gets better, whoever installed the landscaping sprinkler controller ran the wires through the wall and into a PVC pipe that runs on a downgrade from the garden to the wall.  The PVC terminates right behind where the gutter ends, no effort was made to seal any of this.  When the gutter back flows into that area water runs down the PVC and follows the wires through the wall. [https://imgur.com/qN0ADrD](https://imgur.com/qN0ADrD)

I'll address these issue with downspout extensions, removing the PVC and sealing the holes. The cement the AC units are on here are actually downgraded away from the house so water naturally does move away from the foundation.

So for the insulation, I was going to just replace in kind with some R-13 of the same style, but it obvious to me that fiberglass insulation is not always the recommended choice for basements so I wanted to see what a better choice would be. I assume a foam board maybe?  Not sure if that makes sense to just put into the studs. A few things to note:

1) The cement wall behind the studs has some sort of spray coating, and there is a runner at the bottom. As I understand this runner is supposed to direct water away from the foundation I guess? (this is what my inspector told me way back). Seen in this photo: [https://imgur.com/JEhW3JU](https://imgur.com/JEhW3JU)

2) There is probably 1 inch of space between the cement wall and the studs and the insulation. I assume this lets the fiber insulation breath, so re-using fiber insulation is probably not the end of the world option.

3) The area where it goes direct to brick (no cement wall) with 1/2 to 3/4 aluminum sided insulated sheathing between the studs and the brick (this is where the water damage is the worst.  I will repair this sheathingand seal with aluminum tape I think? [https://imgur.com/HdxJh7y](https://imgur.com/HdxJh7y)

ney0er,Moldy attic Remediation,"Hi,

Not sure if this is the right place for this. I am a first-time house owner living in Washington state the house is 19 years old and know that some mold in the attic is commonplace for this area. However, just had a mold inspector come to the house and they found a lot of black mold all over the roof of the attic. To the point they need an air respirator, they do not do abatement so there should not be any conflict of interest I think. They have not come back with the report yet, so no pictures at the moment.

They said there are a few things I have to do;

Get my bath ventilation inspected to ensure there are no leaks,

Get my roof inspected to see if there are any issues,

Get my attic ventilation inspected to see if there is good airflow,

Get the mold in the attic treated,

Remove and replace all the insulation.

I have been looking around to see what is the best way to approach this, from what I have read so far is should I hire a house inspector so they can come in to check the bath ventilation, attic ventilation, and a roof inspection. Then get hire a team to come in and get rid of the mold and remove and replace the insulation. Then depending on the issue that the inspector finds; hire someone to fix the roof or the ventilation.

So my question what is the best way to approach this situation?  Could I do the inspection myself?  Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!",0,1,HomeImprovement,1425

newbka,Tankless gas vs Heat Pump Hot water Heater,"Amazing redditors,

I am trying to figure out whether or not to go with a tankless gas hot water heater or a heat pump hot water heater. The installation would be in the mechanical section of a half finished basement with the furnace for the central AC that is somewhat damp (and maybe two dehumidifiers to help control the moisture). We are a family of 5 people and would say we have a moderate to high hot water demand. Currently, we have a 40 gallon gas hot water heater and we run into issues if we run the dishwasher and everyone takes showers in the evening.

I am guessing we would be okay on a 65 gallon heat pump hot water heater but I am leaning towards 80 gallon if we go for the heat pump which would make it less efficient.

The way I am thinking about this is that heat pump hot water heater would dehumidify the basement and take the place of the dehumidifiers. This would also cool the basement in the summers and borrow heat from the furnace in the winters. My guess is that on dehumidifying I am going to spend two hundred dollars per year. It will also heat the house in the summer when I would likely be using it the most.

Our electricity cost here is pretty high at 25c per KWH.  Natural gas prices are about $14 per 1000 cu feet also quite high.

We have 4' walls, CMU block foundation and a pre-existing concrete floor.  95% of the plumbing and the heat pump air handler are down there.  I've had 3 different ""crawlspace"" companies come in as well as accidentally a 4th option through my power company in the process of an energy audit.

I've been through the DOE's Guide to Closing and Conditioning Vented Crawlspaces (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/54859.pdf) and crawlspace.org and some threads on greenbuildingadvisor.com.

Company B's rep said it looks like I had a painted coating on my floor already.

FWIW, the energy audit people also want to sell me plastic for the floor and say it's highly recommended but not required since it's not insulation and I can't get a rebate on it.

I taped a piece of foil to the floor for several days and just peeled it up and it was perfectly dry underneath.  So...was that a pointless test or does that mean I don't need poly on the floor?  I have no idea if there is a vapor barrier UNDER the concrete slab but if there was would that negate the need for poly on top of the floor?

I'm graduating from medical school in a week. I have 290k personally in student loans, with interest rates varying from 3.4-7.6%. I had planned to do a REPAYE loan payment program, using my 2020 W2 to apply, giving me a payment of $0/month until I have to update my income. I will be working at a PSLF-qualifying hospital and my interests in medicine will keep me at such an institution in the future.

Yesterday, my mother let me know that I'll also be paying on my Parent PLUS loans, as she isn't able to cover them. There is about $65k in her name. I've learned that Parent PLUS loans can't be transferred into my name without refinancing to a private loan, thus making the loan no longer forgivable through a PSLF.

Mom is also eligible for PSLF through her job and will be for at least a decade as well, so I'm planning on setting her PLUS loans on an income-driven plan and paying on those simultaneously.

Given my interest in doing a PSLF, does it make the most sense to keep the Parent PLUS loans in her name and to pay the minimum payment on both sets of loans (mine and hers) for the next 10 years? I'd like to put as little money into them as possible, both monthly and in the long-term. 

I'm here to make sure that there are no other refinancing or consolidation options that I am missing. I'm a first-gen student and don't know the ropes very well.

Let's say I have a total of $250,000 in loans most of them are at around 5-8% interest

$50,000 of the loans are currently due at 5%.

The rest ($200,000) will start to be due in mid September (varies from 5-8% in interest).

Do you recommend refinancing the $50,000 that is currently due in payments as soon as possible or just refinancing the whole $250,000 including the loans that aren't due until September.

nffsn2,Project post - partial first floor makeover: Paint and floors refinishing,"https://imgur.com/a/MzaRfHb - link to album. 

TL:DR 

Painted main floor and kitchen grey (SW Grey Screen #7071, cashmere flat) from beige and changed floors from natural stain and gloss finish to a grey/dark brown (75% Jacobean/25% aged barrel minwax stain) and Bona mega one satin water based polyurethane finish. Replaced couch.

After about a year in the builder beige main floor we wanted to change things up to a lighter color and more modern look. Decided on a light tone grey, which sent us down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out the right grey. After looking at about 12-15 greys, gray screen, which is a cool blue undertone grey won out. Spent a few days in my spare time running around putting drywall mud over the numerous nail holes and any really bad spots. The drywall is in not the best shape and whoever did the initial taping and mudding did not know how to do butt joints because you can see every piece of drywall and where it starts and ends. Also nail holes. I didn’t bother filling those in since I am bit lazy and most people don’t notice it as much as me. After spackling I went over the wall with a 9” sander to level everything a bit and knockoff old drips and ridges. Take off outlets, vent covers, thermostats, doorbells ringers, security things, curtains/blinds, etc. Don’t be that homeowner!

This was the 2nd paint endeavor of the house and this time around I watched a lot more video on how to cut properly and it paid off a lot. In the rooms I did before the cutting was sloppy and best and this time it was pretty good, with only a few area that are ""too much"" on the ceiling.

Cost breakdown:

5 gallons cashmere: ~$240 – there’s a lot leftover for touchups.

Assortment of brushes (angled and straight) and rollers (3/8” nap 9”), extension poles, sanding pole and sheets ~$100

Aluminum work platform for cutting in ceiling: $79

We were quoted about 650 for labor only on this job, would have been reasonable but with 3 people the job was done in a day.  


Floors: $2.50/sqft – $1250 total
While I enjoy DIY projects and don’t hire out much, sanding the floors and refinishing was not something I wanted to do. Emailed about 7 different floor refinishers in the area for quotes. 4 got back to me, 1 came out and 3 gave estimates with pictures. The area is only about 450 sq ft and is one big rectangle with 2 small “hallways” for doors in/out and to basement with a closet. Quotes came in between 2.40-3.25 sqft. 
When talking with the contractors it was important to see what was included in the base price and what was extra. Some places charged more for trendy colors like white/grey/black, others charged more for custom blending, or a 3rd poly coat. 


Once we had the date picked the process was 2 days, 1 for sanding and staining, 1 for final poly coats. The house smelled pretty bad for about a week after and it lingers for a week or two after that. 

Finishing touch was the couch, which fits the area much more nicely that the large sectional which took up a ton of room on the front wall near the bay window. 

Total cost for the project: approximately 2569

Last winter I asked the same guy I dealt with before, what would happen to my warranty if I got more roof vents installed in the spring. He said their company would have to do the work if I want to keep the warranty. I was fine with that.

So I recently called them and said I wanted to get some vents installed. I also told them that I am  re-insulating the attic, and I want to get the vents done while there's no insulation in the attic. That way I can more easily install rafter chutes, ie baffles, ie insulation stops. They set up an appointment to do an estimate. I waited all that day and they didn't show. I called them and they apologized - said the technician was really busy and would try to drop by the next day after the job he was on. He did not drop by; I called back again: more apologies, another promise. I also learned that in making all these arrangements, I had been dealing with one person whom I assumed to be some sort of secretary. But in fact their title is, ""Health and Safety Administrator/Service Manager/Special Projects Manager"" Then they failed to show a third time. 

All this took about two weeks. I called them back, determined to get an explanation. Their story had now changed: The job is very complicated. They have to coordinate with insulators to determine the best course of action. This normally costs 300 dollars, and they were only sending someone to my house as a courtesy. I am frustrated.

The knob probably was easier to remove when it was newer, but now it's really rusted.

nfclxr,[Question] Sealing around copper radiant heating baseboards and the floor?,"Hi There,

We have a house with radiant heat and due to some recent work in the basement have realized just how much dust blows up through the opening that lets the hot water piping up from the basement. On the main floor we have radiant hot water baseboards in almost every room so there are quite a few spots where there are drilled holes in the floor. 

Is this something that could be sealed safely? Since hot water runs through the piping, I wouldn't want to put anything there that might melt or be a fire hazard. I would also be in favor of something that would be removable (like a rubber washer) in case any baseboards needed particular repair. The gap in most places is pretty small (less than 5 mm).

nfc24c,HVAC Condensate into Sealed Sump Pit? Alternatives?,"We just bought our first home. Just after getting the keys I purchased an AirThings radon monitor and installed it in the basement where my readings averaged about 2.8-3.4 pcl. Fast forward 2-3 weeks, a few days before we were set to move in, the reading has shot up to the low 5's. I've researched sealed sump pit lids and am confident I can install a lid, fan, and all the necessary PVC plumbing to exhaust it outside above the roof line like it should be.

I want to DIY this if it's at all feasible, but I also don't want to waste time & money and not see any improvement.

So, a couple questions;

* My natural gas furnace's condensate line drains into the open sump pit. Can't really seal a condensate line as-is, it goes straight down to the floor and then gravity takes it the \~30-40' to the pit. **Could I drain the condensate line into a sealed sump pit lid if I install a P-trap on the condensate line?**
* I also have a dehumidifier draining by drip hose into the sump well. I can move that to another corner of the basement where there's a floor drain, where the W/D go into the city sewer (this drain is also equipped with a backflow preventer system). **For purposes of radon mitigation, I assume this drain is fine as-is since it's porous and goes into the city sewer?**
* The house was built in 1942, and at some point a crew came in here & apparently installed some tile drain. The west wall and south wall have non-original concrete poured, and a sort of egg-crate looking dimpled material between the wall & the poured foundation. Since the same non-original concrete surrounds the sump pit and the floor drain into the sewer, this work was probably all done at the same time. **Does this grey plastic/foam baffling/egg-crate material need sealed if I seal the sump pit? Should I just seal the sump pit and see if my radon levels go down, or do we know for sure that this will be a ""half measure""? If I seal it & create negative pressure in those drain tiles, will I be drawing air into a PVC tile from the basement through the baffles instead of the radon under the slab?**

nfc11w,The distance between two vertical planks in a porch skirt,"I'm building a porch skirt with pvc trim board. The boards will be oriented vertically, almost like a fence. I need to add ventilation by spacing the boards apart, but 1/4"" spacing is looking a bit ""gap tooth""-sh.

nfc047,Re-routing dryer vent. Opinions/advice?,"So my laundry room is on the top floor. Currently, the dryer vent runs up a wall, and when it reaches the attic it turns horizontal and exits out the side of the house (approximately where the orange arrow is in the pic). The total length if the vent is probably over 30 feet, with one 90 degree bend.

About once a year the lint builds up and I need to clean out the vent. Problem is, because of the slope of my lot I can't reach exit point from the outside (it's pretty high up, even my extension ladder is too short). There isn't much I can do from the inside either, especially since most of the buildup is near the exit and it's 30+ feet away from where the dryer connects inside. So my only option is to climb in the attic, disassemble the vent, bring each section outside for cleaning, then reassemble it in the attic. Obviously this is not ideal and it's compounded by the fact that the vent is buried beneath a good two feet of insulation.

What I'd like to do is re-route the vent out the back of the house. The laundry area is near the exterior wall, so running the vent this way would be very easy and I already have an idea of how I would route it and finish it off inside. Option A would be to run the vent beneath the ceiling, and it would exit near the soffit where the red dot is in the pic. The green dot represents Option B, which would be to keep the vent lower and have it exit probably a few feet below the soffit. If I hug the floor I'd actually be a couple feet lower than the green dot. With either of these options, I'd still have a 90 degree bend but the total run would be under 12 feet. So the advantages of these options are that the total length of the vent is much shorter, and I can make it so that it's easily accessible if/when it needs to be cleaned periodically.

Here's where I'm looking for opinions/advice. I do have soffit vents that provide ventilation for my attic. Obviously I don't want all that moisture from the dryer vent to get pulled into my attic through the soffit vents. How close is too close to the soffit?


TLDR; Id like to re-route my dryer vent so that I do not have to go through my attic to clean the vent. The new exit would be on the exterior wall, but in close proximity to a soffit vent. How far beneath the soffit should I plan on placing the vent so that moisture from the vent does not get pulled into my attic?

We live in a semi-detached house in the UK. The cooker is not against an outside wall so we can’t have an extractor direct to the outside.

Opening windows and doors also helps but winter....

Remodelling the kitchen to have cooker on outside wall would involve too much expense and complications ... moving the entrance door for example and the knock on effects that have on the living room.

nf1yx2,Bitumen roof leaking around brick chimney.,"What can I do with this leaking chimney?
https://imgur.com/a/vPo2zo6

**TL;DR: Can I retrofit flashing somehow if there is none?**

The roof is bitumen/tar, coated with a silver/metallic reflective layer. The roof overall seems in good shape, it was put on about five years ago, it seems whoever did the roof decided to cover the brick chimney with tar at the same time, the chimney was completely covered in tar/roofing cement, which has dried up and is pulling away from the brick, I started pulling the tar off to see what was behind, and sure enough it was wet and moldy. The uncovered part is what I have exposed so far.

I am not sure whether there is flashing under the tar at the bottom part of the chimney, I hope there is.

My plan is to remove the tar on the top part of the chimney, repoint the brickwork and then seal the brick with a paint-on drylok siloxane masonry sealer.

My concern is what to do around the bottom part/flashing area. How low should I go pulling off the tar? If I find no flashing as I go down, what can I do?

Is it possible to retro-fit flashing *over* the existing built-up-roof, with additional layers of bitumen and cement on top of the new flashing? Or instead would I need to pull up the roof around the chimney all the way down to the sheathing in order to install flashing?

Thanks very much for any advice.

nf1tpo,Tankless water heater flush Newbie,"My Navien tankless water heater threw an Error 46 a few days ago. I could not find much on Error 46, high limit error other than a flush might help. I thought it was a long shot,  but for a $100 bucks. The last time this thing blew a valve, it was $300 to repair and the part was under warranty.  I can only imagine what it will cost to replace a $5 limit switch.

So I bought all of the Vinegar in Wally World, some washing machine hoses and a utility pump. The hot water shutoff is jammed and washing machine hoses don't quite work. The connections for the hoses are too shallow,  so even over tightening the hoses still left a slight dribble on the hot connection. I think two washers might solve the problem. Seems like a scam to prevent the homeowner from doing it themselves. 

I turned off the gas, pulled the plug, turned off the water, attached my water hoses and opened the drain valves to drain the water into my bucket. I drained my bucket, added three gallons of vinegar and started my pump. I had to tighten my hoses a bit more, but the hot still dribbled. Any tighter and I would snap off those cheap ass valves. I came back at about an hour and I had 3 gallons of blue vinegar. I came back at 90 minutes and my bucket was almost overflowing? Where did the extra 2 gallons of liquid come from?

nf1ome,How should I get drip line into and across cement patio i'm about to pour,"So I need to demolish and pour a concrete patio. Since we're doing it we want to run a drip line that will go to 2 planter boxes and a 2nd zone drip line that will go to a tree. The issue is the garbage cans are kept in an alley that the drip line needs to cross.

So far I have 3 ideas on how this could be done based on my search for similar projects or solutions.

[Option 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9yKPF2ulPhTmVvu623Wks-ybIQWx3un/view?usp=sharing)

A 90° 3/4"" pipe straight down. Run in the dirt under the cement to the end of the cement and then back up through it to connect a battery powered 2 zone drip line to.  I'm thinking Galvanized steel pipe as I'm concerned PVC could get broken somehow and if it happens at ground level, there'd be no way to connect anything to it so it would be all for not.

[Option 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wjDuwzUxs1Z-8AeUY8IvL9MA-_xCiP1w/view?usp=sharing)

The alley cans are in is slightly higher than the cement patio, I could run a 1 1/2"" steel pipe on top of the cement and sort of make a cement ramp over it. So I could run the 2 drip lines along walls, through the pipe at ground level and then along fence to yard.

Option 3

Basically same design as option 1 but with large plastic schedule 40 PVC pipe (1 1/2""?). Most of the suggestions online say to  push drip lines through PVC below ground. But this is usually in a straight line under a path or driveway and not something that has to go horizontally into ground in at least 1 location. My concerns with this is 90° even if it was a large PVC may cause lines to get fold and block. Or that I will not be able to thread it back through the PVC if something went wrong with the lines. In this case though, PVC outlet could at least be flush with cement.

Open to other options if there's a better one, but which option is the best? My primary concern is it's fixable or will last 30 years. Cost isn't too much of a deciding factor but the tools involved in pex seem to make it more cost effective to do metal. But not concerned about the difference between 16' and 2' of metal or how much cheaper plastic schedule 40 would be. Ease of install, a bit of a factor as I mess up plumbing when I've touched it before. I'm in San Francisco so if it gets below freezing it's a few days a year max and not much colder than 32°.",7,1,HomeImprovement,2339
ney9t0,Why is Hot Water Heater T&P valve opening?,"Background: Hot water heater is 11 years old, I am original owner. Through its life, have replaced the T&P valve 3 times (most recently a few months ago). I have replaced the cold water intake expansion tank once (few months ago). It’s always seemed a little odd. Have had plumber come to house recently and pressure to my house has been right about 50psi. 

What’s happening: T&P will open and leak out maybe 1-2 gallons of water, but this only seems to occur if I’m away for a weekend or longer, and the water hasn’t been used in a few days.  It maybe has happened once when I’ve been home but by and large it’s when water isn’t even being used. Plumber recommended new expansion tank and T&P which I did and still the problem persists. Once in April when I was away for 2 nights. Then last week when I was gone for a week, BUT before I left I turned the temp of the hot water heater way down.  That makes me think this is a pressure related issue.

Going forward: Only things that remain to replace are: 1) house pressure regulator or 2) whole hot water heater. My fear is I replace the hot water heater and still have the same damn problem. But on the other hand the house pressure seems correct when tested. I will say sometimes when I flush a toilet and the tank is refilling it seems like the water flow sounds different/ stronger, like a momentary higher pressure. Talking with others in my neighborhood no one else seems to have this issue so pressure idea seems wrong. 

Has anyone experienced this or have an idea of the cause?

ndlcu6,Brand new enamel tub is rusting.,"I just installed a brand new enamel steel tub and it's starting to rust.  I think there might be due to micro fractures or scratches because it feels rougher in the base of the tub.  Anyways, is there any way I could clean out the rust and seal it easily so it doesn't rust any more?   Like maybe a wax type product?   I'd really prefer to no need to paint it because I don't trust my painting ability.  [Here's a close up of the rust.](https://imgur.com/a/VtT5Ptf)

Edit:  A couple more facts:

* it was purchased recently but returning it for a warranty isn't an option because it's been tiled in.
* the contractor who installed it removed the supporting styrofoam block so it flexed and theres a belly where water sits.  This may have also resulted in some micro cracks too.
* When my friend was installing the tile, he was wearing boots that had dirt on it and this scratched the enamel a bit.   I believe this is why the bottom feels rougher than the sides.

Edit 2: I emailed the company (Bootz) and this is there response.  It sounds promising!  Here's the email:

>I am sorry about the issue you are having with your newly installed  tub.  A lot of the times during installation, debris gets caught in the  non-skid of the tub.  Once the tub is placed into use, the construction  debris starts to rust.  It looks like the tub is rusting, but it is  actually the debris that is rusting.  We recommend the following  cleaning procedure, as rinsing it out and regular cleaning using don't  do the trick:

** Problem:
Had no written contract with contractor. Wasn’t happy with work contractor did. Froze credit card so that they wouldn’t prematurely charge me before work was completed. Now contractor has disabled all phone numbers associated with their company. Pretty sure I was scammed. **

Can they come back months/years and force me to pay them?

————————

Summary: 
I hired a chimney contracting company based off of first search on Google (first mistake). 

I did successfully pay them $129 for an inspection in which I said I needed my crown replaced and mortar between the bricks. They told me it would cost $1200 but I never got a written contract as to them agreeing what work will be done (second mistake). 

They came by three days later and added mortar in between the bricks but they did not professionally add a new crown. I told the contractor I had a problem with this and they said to call management. Before he left I called management saying I had problem with the job and they said that they will get another tech out there to review the work the next day. I felt a little off so I quickly froze my credit card. Not 1 hour later a charge of $1200 came through and was declined because I froze my card. (Only right thing I did). 

Management called me back ( obviously because I haven’t paid them) and said that they will try their best to rectify the problem. This was 5 days ago. 

As of last Friday all phone numbers associated with their company have been disabled and just keeps ringing for 5 min+. I have tried everyday twice a day and nothing. 

I’m pretty sure I was scammed. What am I liable for? I changed my credit card info so they can’t charge me unknowingly. But do I need do do anything so that I’m not liable for charges? (I’m not looking for my $129 back I know that’s long gone)",2,1,HomeImprovement,2333

nffsn2,Project post - partial first floor makeover: Paint and floors refinishing,"https://imgur.com/a/MzaRfHb - link to album. 

TL:DR 

Painted main floor and kitchen grey (SW Grey Screen #7071, cashmere flat) from beige and changed floors from natural stain and gloss finish to a grey/dark brown (75% Jacobean/25% aged barrel minwax stain) and Bona mega one satin water based polyurethane finish. Replaced couch.

After about a year in the builder beige main floor we wanted to change things up to a lighter color and more modern look. Decided on a light tone grey, which sent us down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out the right grey. After looking at about 12-15 greys, gray screen, which is a cool blue undertone grey won out. Spent a few days in my spare time running around putting drywall mud over the numerous nail holes and any really bad spots. The drywall is in not the best shape and whoever did the initial taping and mudding did not know how to do butt joints because you can see every piece of drywall and where it starts and ends. Also nail holes. I didn’t bother filling those in since I am bit lazy and most people don’t notice it as much as me. After spackling I went over the wall with a 9” sander to level everything a bit and knockoff old drips and ridges. Take off outlets, vent covers, thermostats, doorbells ringers, security things, curtains/blinds, etc. Don’t be that homeowner!

This was the 2nd paint endeavor of the house and this time around I watched a lot more video on how to cut properly and it paid off a lot. In the rooms I did before the cutting was sloppy and best and this time it was pretty good, with only a few area that are ""too much"" on the ceiling.

Cost breakdown:

5 gallons cashmere: ~$240 – there’s a lot leftover for touchups.

Assortment of brushes (angled and straight) and rollers (3/8” nap 9”), extension poles, sanding pole and sheets ~$100

Aluminum work platform for cutting in ceiling: $79

We were quoted about 650 for labor only on this job, would have been reasonable but with 3 people the job was done in a day.  


Floors: $2.50/sqft – $1250 total
While I enjoy DIY projects and don’t hire out much, sanding the floors and refinishing was not something I wanted to do. Emailed about 7 different floor refinishers in the area for quotes. 4 got back to me, 1 came out and 3 gave estimates with pictures. The area is only about 450 sq ft and is one big rectangle with 2 small “hallways” for doors in/out and to basement with a closet. Quotes came in between 2.40-3.25 sqft. 
When talking with the contractors it was important to see what was included in the base price and what was extra. Some places charged more for trendy colors like white/grey/black, others charged more for custom blending, or a 3rd poly coat. 


Once we had the date picked the process was 2 days, 1 for sanding and staining, 1 for final poly coats. The house smelled pretty bad for about a week after and it lingers for a week or two after that. 

Finishing touch was the couch, which fits the area much more nicely that the large sectional which took up a ton of room on the front wall near the bay window. 

Total cost for the project (including couch): approximately 2569

nfjbaa,Adding a patio that could HOPEFULLY double as a parking spot in small backyard. Thoughts?,"We have a house with a very small back yard with no real patio. The part of the backyard that extends from the house to the front of the garage is about 9 feet by 26 feet, and slopes upward about 14 inches off the back of the house (about 7.5 degrees incline). 

What I'd like is to flatten this area of the backyard and turn it into a flat and very simple patio, with a retaining wall, but what I'd LOVE is to have the area also double as a parking spot.

[https://imgur.com/a/9aLkvbK](https://imgur.com/a/9aLkvbK)

The biggest problem is the incline. While the driveway is wide enough to be able to pull my car into that spot (and the ""parking spot"" itself, at 9 feet wide, is wide enough to park into), the 14"" drop at its tallest point would be impossible for my car to get into or out of.

As far as I can tell, here are my options. I'd love your opinions on which of these is most feasible, and which ones are not feasible at all.

1) Have a hump that smooths out that steep drop. Not sure how spread out of a hump it'd have to be to be usable, it might eat into the patio quite a bit.

2) Can I raise the entire patio to split the difference (like 8 inches up, with gradual incline on the low point, and a gradual decline off the high point)? To do this we'd have to build into the back of the house (and I wouldn't want it to NOT be attached to the house, or else there'd be a ditch there). I'm not sure if that's possible.

3) Ditch the parking spot idea altogether. This would suck, as eventually we have plans to turn my half of the garage into an office, and I'd love to be able to park my car without tandeming.",0,1,HomeImprovement,1624
nfj824,A little confused about whether I should use 1/4 minus or (5/8 or 3/4) minus for paver and retaining wall base,"So I'm planning on landscaping a retaining wall and a paver patio. Most recommendations I've read online suggesting using 3/4 minus over 1/4 minus, although there are a few recommendations for either. For the purposes of this comparison, I'm assuming 5/8 is comparable to 3/4 which is what is offered around me. 

Reddit Examples:  
 * [Retaining wall - 1 rec for 1/4, 2 for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/60s6r7/what_kind_of_gravel_can_i_use_as_a_base_for_my/)

 * [Retaining wall - rec for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/j6txde/two_retaining_wall_questions_should_i_try_and/)  
 * [Paver - rec for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/hibj26/question_about_paver_base_and_gravel/)  
 * [Paver - rec for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/99n3q7/question_on_which_of_these_to_use_for_base_of/)  
 * [Paver - rec for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/a3fh3m/help_what_to_use_as_base_under_paver_patio/)  

The problem I'm having trouble reconciling is that at almost every topsoil vendor I look at, they say that 1/4 is used as a base and that 5/8 is used for pathways and driveways. Considering 5/8 is slightly smaller than 3/4, I don't see how this doesn't stand up favorably to the recommendations I'm seeing. 

Example: http://nwlandscapesupply.com/products/crushed-rock/  
 * ""Crushed Rock – 1/4″ minus: Perfect for under pavers and flagstone...""  
 * ""Crushed Rock – 5/8″ minus: Compactable base material used for driveways and pathways.""  

Example: https://www.sbsg.com/products/sbsg-bulk-aggregates/  
 * ""Our 1/4″ minus crushed gravel contains crushed aggregate that is 1/4″ to dust. It packs very tightly and offers better compaction and stability as a base for pavers, retaining walls...""  
 * ""Washed 5/8 Minus Crushed Gravel. Also referred to as “CSTC” or Crushed Surface Top Coarse. This crushed gravel is primarily used for driveways and walkways.""  

A couple others mention 5/8 for use with retaining walls, but not pavers. 1/4 is often recommended for pavers. If I were to pick one mix for both paver base and wall base (< 4'), should it be 1/4 or 5/8? Should I be using 1/4 for pavers and 5/8 for the wall ideally? I'd rather use the same so I'm not requiring multiple deliveries. Am I overthinking this and either would be fine?

Thanks in advance for some advice. 

I am building a new roof over my front porch. However, I’m not sure where to route the j channel so that it doesn’t fill with water and just sit. 

The original plan was to run the j channel up the side of the roof, on top of the step flashing. However if I do that and run it into the horizontal j channel it won’t have anywhere to drain. 

(Side note, I don’t know where it drained before. However, my house was not built well regarding water evacuation, so I’d love to know the correct way to do it)

nfpt2r,"Best way to install fence posts at a community garden I volunteer at where concrete is not allowed, and the water table is about 10 inches down and constantly fills the holes with water?","Hello!

I have been volunteering at some local community gardens. Its a lot of fun and there are tons of Gardners who are older and unable to do a lot of the physical work so I have been helping out.

The main thing I have been helping them with is replacing the fences between gardens. The fences are very important to keep out animals and keep people from stealing from the gardens which is a huge issue. As a rule, concrete is not allowed at all as it would hurt the plants, and the older residents would never be able to remove it later on.

I was taught the ""proper"" way they recommend installing fences, but it is really frustrating and still leads to wobbly supports, so I wanted to ask if there is a better way. Currently we will use clam shell post hole diggers to dig down anywhere from 24-36 inches down into the soil. After digging down around 10 inches the bottom of the hole starts to fill with water and by the time you get to 28 inches or more the hole is full of water up to about the 10 inches down point, so up to 20 inches of water. Then, we will take a 8 foot 4x4 and put it in the hole, making sure the pole is straight with a level. Then we will start to fill the hole with sand, but because the holes are so full of water the sand raises the water level and sinks to the bottom, bringing the water level all the way up to the top of the hole. We will try and put about 6-10 inches of sand and tamp it down with a tamping tool, but mostly the pole just sinks into the mug mixture at the bottom. Then I will try and add the soil back that we took out and tamp it down, but again it will turn into a mud and the tool just sinks in, barely compacting it. I try and push more and more soil in till the mug gets pretty thick, but that is the best I can do and we usually leave it there.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/8LfzYvs) is what finished fence posts look like with this method.

Is there a better way to do this? Should I try and get a hand water pump to get the water out? When I try and scoop it out it very quickly refills, but maybe I can try and quickly fill it after pumping? Also, should we use something other than Sand like gravel? Also, what kind of wood should we use? Is there a wood that would last longer in the ground with how wet this soil is so they don't have to be replaced so often?

What was supposed to be a simple resurfacing of my deck has predictably evolved into a complete replacement with the discovery of rot at every step of the project. 
The original deck it turns out didn’t have a ledger board- the deck joists were attached to the rim joist of the house using hangers, with siding applied between the joists and a proper drip edge at the bottom transitioning to the siding beneath the deck, there was also a drip edge properly applied above the deck. The house was built in ‘74, not sure if this was accepted practice at the time but I can’t seem to find any reference to this practice in my googling. 

Despite the rot plaguing the rest of the deck, the houses rim joist is luckily in perfect shape. Nonetheless, I would like to build the new deck with a ledger board and the structure of the house safely isolated from anything going on with the deck.

My question is what to do with exposed rim joist before mounting the ledger board. My current plan is to cover the exposed wood of the rim joist with adhesive flashing I have on hand, then run 14”aluminum flashing beneath the siding above the exposed area down to the existing drip edge (overlapping of course), with the ledger board being installed against the aluminum.
Is the adhesive flashing redundant given that aluminum flashing will cover the whole area? Any reason not to use the roll I have on hand? There is a door above the ledger I intend to flash properly, but it’s still a potential source of moisture so I thought I’d just tape up the bare wood for good measure. 

I’ve only been able to source rolls of 14” aluminum flashing locally- any compelling reason to track down the vinyl equivalent?

nfn2f1,Need a sanity check on drywall estimate and expectations,"We demoed our basement last summer. Now need some drywall company to hang drywall, finish it (mud, primer and paint) and then install baseboard. I just need to know if I am being taken advantage or is my idea of what it would cost is completely off.

Details from the most recent quote are further down.

**My home**

Our basement is not big, to give a good idea of the size of the basement, it is rancher that is around 1500 sq ft total, half of that is the basement, and 2/3 of that basement is being drywalled... As indicated in the details below there is no need to drywall the ceiling, so just walls. We have a drop ceiling and are keeping it. 99.9% of the framing is intact. Just a few planks need to be reinstalled. I live about 1hr north of DC.

**Quote background**

Originally the quote was for 15k, which was about 2x what I thought it would be (wrong or right, someone call tell me that) however got the quote down to 10k - but that is **without materials**... Without materials? Is that normal? Nonetheless, I could have sworn, and when I have a call with the salesman I will bring this up, he said he is removing material from the cost (when I balked at the 15k price). In our conversation today he is claiming he never said that, he is just shrinking his profit margin. Not how I remember it at all. So I asked him to provide me an estimate on the cost of materials, which will then probably get it back up close to 15k again. Is 15k a decent price? Is 10k? I was thinking around 7k? Is that unreasonable?

Edit: Note: I had quotes for the entire basement remodel, including the bathroom (these companies were going to do it all, but I decided to go a la carte) for 18k, 25k and 72k (that was ridiculous and I assume they didn't want the job). I based my expectations on those quotes. I already had electric done, just needs to be finished once walls get hung and finished. Carpet will be done later after walls are hung and before baseboard.

**Quote details**

*3 resources, 7 days.*

**Installation of Drywall to walls (no ceiling)**

* Hung, taped, floated ready for paint (use appropriate sized screws - furring strips for framing)
* Install, seal, and paint baseboards
* Prime walls and ceiling - 1 coat
* Paint walls and ceiling - 2 coats (Included is one touch up walk through with customer prior to paint job)

nfmryd,Question on House Foundation," 

We are buying a house that seems to have a very strange foundation, and wondered if anyone could tell us what type it is. It was built in 1962. It has a basement with concrete block walls. One room is finished, and the interior walls are set in about 2 feet in from the exterior walls. The way we know this is that the windows are in the exterior walls, of course, but then they are kind of boxed in for about 2 feet to get to the interior walls, much like a skylight. I've never seen this before.

Then in the unfinished basement room, at first it appears that the interior walls are just normal block walls, but then when you look at the window, you can see that the window is set back about 2 feet from the interior wall. This would be the same as in the finished room described above, except that you can actually see the block instead of it being boxed in to hide the block. So strangely, it appears that there are interior block walls that are set in about 2 feet from the exterior block walls, unless I'm missing something.

Then from outside the house, (on the high side of the hill, so the ground is close to the house level), there is a small door for access to something. Normally I wouldn't expect to see a crawl space since it has a basement, but you open the access door and see a space that looks like a crawl space, and you see some type of block there that is about 2 feet wide, consistent with what we see inside the house. I can't see too much inside this crawl space, but it looks kind of like 2 ft pillars? I'm really not sure because I can't see very far inside. The space here is maybe 2 feet tall, and I can't tell how far this space goes under the house, but it can't be very far because the basement walls must start not far from this opening.

Did they ever build houses in the early 60s with double basement walls? It's the strangest thing I've ever seen. Hoping someone can shed some light on this. Thanks so much.",5,1,HomeImprovement,1946

Inexperienced homeowner here. We bought a really nicely finished apartment last September, but many things seem to fall apart after the 'staging' the sellers had done (the last renovation was also done around 15 years ago so some things can also be expected to have to be replaced).

Disappointment aside, we are really struggling to find specialists to repair things.

We are based in Amsterdam and finding contractors that are available or even responding to requests seems to be difficult. 

We finally found someone able to repair our bathroom tile floor (grout had washed away and was causing water damage).
The work that he had done is fine but not perfect. There are smudges and the tiles around the drain already seem chipped. 
It also seems like some of the glue / grouting has been washed down the shower drain, which I believe could cause blockages on the longer run (but am not sure), for now it also really doesn't look nice.
In addition, our lacquered wooden floor around the bathroom has many new scratches on it.
When I asked about his insurance re the floor scratches he offered to come back and repair the wooden floor.

Is it a good idea to accept? Considering he is specialised in tiles, could it be possible that he will cause even more damage to our wooden floor?

And should I ask to replace the tiles that have already chipped?

In addition, he is constantly extremely late to agreed appointments and starting times.

I am not sure what to think and would be grateful for some wise words or experience shared.

1. From the photos, does it look like the wood needs to be stripped, or does it look like it would be OK with just a wash?
2. How do you know if it needs to be sanded down? If we do sand it down, do we need a floor sander unit to do it and any advice there as neither my husband nor I have ever really done any woodworking.
3. I know it will need a nice wash, but do we need to pressure wash or not pressure wash? I have seen conflicting information online - some say pressure washing can damage the wood and a regular high power hose should work fine.

nfqw5d,Unusual drywall?,"I need to replace the outside corner bead on some drywall in a utility/laundry room (this could be a post onto itself). In the process of figuring out what's going on, I realized the drywall that was used looks different from anything I've seen. 

What it looks like is a normal paper-coated sheet of drywall with a very very thin outer drywall set on top somehow as an outer layer. Either that, or it's a multilayered drywall sheet of some sort resembling what was just described.

The issue is that the metal corner bead (which rusted out over the decades because it's next to a bunch of water appliances) is set into this outer layer rather than being laid on top, if that makes sense. That is, it looks like the thin outer layer was cut away to fit the corner bead exactly, or a large sheet of it was cut to fit in between the two (horizontal and vertical) metal corner beads. 

Is anyone familiar with this? I'm trying to figure out how to repair it. I was going to buy a piece of drywall and replace part of it, and then put a new corner bead in, but then I realized it probably wouldn't sit right because the outer layers of any drywall I've seen are just paper.

My question is the following. The engineer is saying that he will rebuild the load bearing wall with their appropriate studs. Those studs will rest in an aluminum track of 1.5 inches high and the concrete will then be poured in and around that track, encompassing the stud. 

Does that sound right? I always thought you never submerge wood in concrete. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I can clearly smell it when I walk into the living room / kitchen area from the bedroom, indicating to me that the source must not be in the bedroom. But after I’m out in the living room / kitchen for a while I get used to it and don’t consciously smell it until I walk out of the room to the bedroom and then back in.

I checked everything I could think of and I took out all the trash and cleaned up some new cat vomit. I opened the windows for a few minutes. The smell is still there.

nfxxzg,Foundation question,"My partner and I have been living in our house for 5 years and are getting ready to move. After talking about it a lot, we decided not to sell our house. Knowing that we’re going to have the house for 10+ years, I’ve gone back to considering fixing the foundation, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it, and I would love a second opinion.

Our problems: 
-Doors have trouble closing, especially seasonally 
-West side of house has (minor) slant
-Vertical cracking in several walls, like everywhere 

I got an estimate, and this is where they said my levels were. In your opinion, is this need-to-fix territory or not that bad?

https://imgur.com/gallery/TiOJeKY

One of issues is, we live in Central Texas and the soil is clay-heavy (Blackland Prairie) so I’m skeptical of how much a foundation-raising would fix the issue. Also, the foundation was raised at some point by the previous owners. I called the contractors who did it out and they were very dismissive and said it didn’t need any fixing. Overall, I want what’s best for the house, and what will keep the house in good order for as long as possible. I think some of my foundation issues are due to poor drainage (house is a little lower than yard, rain goes towards the house) and plumbing issues (cast iron, yay) which I also plan on fixing (as money allows) but it seems like if I’m gonna raise my foundation, it should be the first thing I do in this series of steps.

Anyways, I apologize for the mouthful and am grateful for any advice!",2,1,HomeImprovement,1498

nfwjuq,Need some electrician help,"Hello again!


http://imgur.com/gallery/5dCAwF6

So one day I realized my fan was busted out and then I found out it wasn't even venting outside! Just back into the attic. So I had a roofing company come out and out an exhaust fan. Want us to install the new fan they asked? 

No thank you I said. Figured it would be easy. Even though I'm not an electrician, I figured I could wire the box the same way.

Old and new fan look like this https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B086XMDSR1#Ask
Any whoooo, to get the fan out was a pain, it was screwed every which way into the joists and had two, 2x4s double rigged to hold the box over the attic. I didn't mind but they would have made it way easier had they ran the 15 1/2 side by the 16 in gap but oh well. They had to do it maybe because its lath and plaster. I get it. 


Anyway. I took some pics of the old fan which is the same exact fan as the new one but old....new fan just had a crimp wire connect and pig tail off it with another small blue wire. Maybe 18awg. 

I have some questions. Yes I turned off the breaker. Made sure to label all of them. I'm in Chicago which I believe has different code than some other places. 

My conduit coming in to the box has 4 wires. 2 black. One red. One white. The bathroom switch has 3 switches. One for the light. The fan. The heater.

Upstairs in my Attic I have a heat pump and two ductless systems in my house. One on each floor. Not sure if this affects my situation. They run on 240v I believe. 

I connected the new box the same way as the old box. I flipped the breaker back on and ran the heater for 5 minutes. And the fan. Didn't connect the lightbulb as I figured that was fine as well. 

 Before I screw everything down. I want to make sure everything is wired correctly? I can hire an electrician but if I can learn for free I think that's a valuable lesson.

Questions I have, are there 3 live wires coming in? The two black and one red? One white is neutral? Does that mean no ground?

Why did the new fan have a blue wire with a double ended connect with a pigtail?

Is the neutral always straight wire while the others are stranded for identification?

Wouldn't the metal casing inside the fan/motor act as a ground? Is a gfi needed? Fan is about 2 feet from shower and 4 feet from shower head. Have a separate gfi panel next to sink.

nfvw2m,Installing Window AC Units in a Victorian Home Safe?,"Hello! I'm in a Victorian Home that has its original windows that do not have any sort of support ridges on the bottom for an AC unit to lock onto; they are completely flat. I don't see any feasible way a traditional window unit could be supported in these windows. I tried googling it since I know there are a lot of folks with Victorian homes, but I found nothing about dealing with window units...

I'm assuming no ridge on a window means there's nothing to keep the in window unit in place, even a smaller 5,000 btu model? 

Unfortunately, drilling is out of the question, so I can't install most support brackets, and the ones that don't require drilling would only be supported on the sides since there's no bottom ridge.

nfvd04,We are trying to plan out our projects and would like some advice.,"So we bought our home roughly a year ago. We decided to wait before we did anything (like replacing the floors) because we wanted to see what the house really needed. There's only so much you'll learn about wants/needs during the home buying process. 

Anyway, we have a list of some big projects and some little projects. We're trying to figure out the most efficient way to go about these projects (example: we don't want to replace the floors now if we're going to have to pull them up later for something else).


Our current project list:


Re-wire the whole house

Fix plumbing (?)

Replacing/fixing bedroom doors

Update bathrooms

Replacing flooring

Paint


This is not everything we're going to do, but it's the main stuff indoors that we're planning. There's some roofing maintenance (nothing emergent) and landscaping we need to do, as well.

If you do not want to continue reading past this point, any advice on the order to do these projects would be much appreciated. The order in which they are listed is our current ""timeline."" 

For more details, please continue reading.

Wiring: 

We know we need to fix the wiring because when we moved in and began installing the wifi, we found numerous dead cables still in the wall, electrical sockets with multiple cables/wires, cables that we didn't notice before we moved in that were not installed high enough in the wall to place a... mount? I forgot the word all of a sudden. The plastic rectangle you screw in to cover/hold things in place. There's cables without them. The previous owners had provided proof that they had someone come out and completely redo the electrical, but at this point, we're pretty sure either they didn't or they picked an awful electrician. (We cannot turn on the fan in our baby's room because it shorted and almost caused a fire, is one example). 

Plumbing has a question mark next to it because we have not determined if it is the plumbing or just the well water pump not working efficiently. It's the water pressure/the amount coming out of some of the faucets, and the washing machine takes forever because of this, as well. Still, it'll likely be costly whether it is the plumbing or just the pump itself. Just something to note.

Everything else is pretty straight forward. We had to take out the bedroom doors because they were broken/uneven/not closing.

The bathrooms need updating. Redoing the tiled showers (they were poorly done, sealants are coming off and grout isn't holding; the floors in the kitchen have the same issue, and some of the floor tiles have popped out of place).

Which leads into why we need to replace the floors. Initially we just wanted to change them for cosmetic reasons, but now we realize we would've needed to anyways. Pretty much everything you can think of was done poorly in the house, which includes the flooring. 

And lastly, we will be repainting.

So, any advice on what order we should do these projects? Or recommendations on what to look out for/be prepared for?

Honestly, anything you think would be helpful given the information above.

(Personally, I'm tempted to just save up to tear the place down and start from scratch cause the electrical is going to equal the cost of just tearing down the house. Estimates for both electrical and demolition are at around 11k).

I live on the topmost floor of an old apartment building. The heat + humidity is punishing in the summer (or even now) and I need to pay extra to use AC.

My plan is to grab a box of light, ceramic floor tiles, and drill holes close to the corner of each tile.

My issue is with the ""links"" themselves, I don't really know what I could use that would allow the tiles to be stable, and yet not have too much of a high profile that walking is painful. The links would also need to be removed come fall so that the tiles could be separated and put away.

The issue, which I can't find a direct answer to, or a concensus from contractor friends, is do I need to vent the area below the subfloor?

Once I block up the garage opening, I will be re-grading that outside area so the sealed crawlspace will be technically below grade. Waterproofing aside, we're talking a ~10"" x 400sqft area that's trapped air. 

The other issue is I live in wetlands, so the rainy season can be rough. Meaning I can't just vent the area near grade, I would need to add some vent pipes within the walls and either vent into the soffits or attics. Possibly with an active system instead of a passive one.

nfy2u7,Old student loan debt,"So this is a long story on behalf of my partner but I am hoping someone has some help they can provide. 

My partner (M now 37) was born into a low income family. He was the oldest of 7 kids through multiple divorces/ remarriages. He was always a quiet reader type and in high school got accepted to a prestigious engineering university (40k+ a year at the time). His parents and the University convinced him to just sign up for all the loans saying they would help, he was young and he and his parents didn't really know any better so he signed all the paperwork. He was doing good at school (biomedical engineering degree) until junior year his mom had a mental breakdown and showed up at his college dorm in her nightgown at 3am and had to be admitted to a psychiatric unit for multiple months for various conditions. His step father was mia so he had to drop out and go home to care for his 4 dependant younger siblings at the time (the 4 younger ones were all under 10 years of age, of the older ones 1 was out of state, the other was a step brother and not of age). The University had no policy for this kind of situation and considered him still enrolled. By the time his mother was able to come back to care for his siblings he was failing all of his classes and the University had kicked him out. Since then he has been saddled with over $120,000 worth of college debt + years of interest and negative credit score, no degree to show for it and any job he gets now debt collectors collect almost all of his paychecks.

nfvvmh,20 Year Loan Refinance | Buy BTC w/ Extra Cash Flow,"Currently I have a 10 year loan with about $100k outstanding. I am about a year in and am considering refinancing to a 20 year loan to lower my monthly payments from 1.1k to 600ish. I'd then plan to invest 200 a month into BTC for a 20 year long HODL. I can make interest by lending out my BTC for periods at a time for addition wealth creation (currently have .2 btc).

Am I crazy?

$100K in 20 years will just mean nothing. If the dollar loses on average 2% a year through inflation - the next years are going to be significant higher. $100K will be worth nothing.

BTC on the other hand has the stored value and could even grow in time. Once we don't think about BTC in terms of dollars, you'll know we're there.

I know it is risky but I'm sick of having to work for money that is constantly loosing value to pay for an overpriced education.

We're planning on getting a garden office building. We want it insulated, with electricity, decent patio/ french doors etc so that it can be worked in all year round.

We've been speaking to a few suppliers who build these things to get quotes and recommendations on how to spec it out. We want it to last a long time, and to be cost-effective (even if those things compete against each other I'm sure there is a decent balance somewhere).

For those that have had an office a while, or have been through getting one built what do you wish you had known before speccing it up, planning it, working or using for fun it? Really want to know anything important that we may overlook, underthink or just not know as garden office novices!

Current thinking is:

* Composite over wooden cladding
* Sliding patio doors over french doors
* 1 x 2kw electric heater
* Power etc wired in along with an ethernet cable for internet and wifi
* Probably looking a bit like this design wise but 5m x 3 https://www.roomsoutdoor.co.uk/uploads/8af/ebc/8afebc0e30c9c4594f3591d70519a2cbb05a91a1/original/8afebc0e30c9c4594f3591d70519a2cbb05a91a1.jpg?storage=media

ng6ix7,Frost-proof spigot replaced. How important is it to insulate around the pipe?,"I moved into a new home 3 months ago and it turns out a frost-proof spigot had frozen and was lying in wait for me to turn it on this spring.  The previous owner failed to winterize it properly and left a shutoff valve installed and closed, so the water couldn't drain out. The pipe burst and caused thousands in damage. At least now I know how to prevent that.

Anyway, a plumber came and replaced the frost-proof spigot with a new one. But it seems the process of pulling the old one out took some of the previous spray foam along with it. So now there's a bit of a gap between the new one and the hole through the exterior of the house. To be clear, I can't see daylight coming through or feel a noticeable draft, but the insulation just isn't as snugged up against it. 

The valve of the new spigot is within the envelope of the home (so it should stay warm), but it's also inside a wall, so perhaps it won't be exposed to as much direct heating. So, how much do I need to worry about plugging this up? I've watched every youtube video I can find about installing one of these, and nearly none of them mention insulating that hole.

I live alone and my water usage isn't much. 2) I can replace a tank water by myself with some help from a friend to move the tanks. 3) I'd love to get rid to the ugly tank and have a little more space in the laundry room. 4) If I go with a tankless heater, I will need a professional to install it adding to the cost overall. 

The tank heater that I'm looking at has a 6 year warranty and is less than $500. The tankless heater is about $600, plus venting, updating gas line, and professional install.

We we considering having a contractor rip it all out and start from scratch, but we actually like the Brick look and think that we can spend a couple hundred dollars including tools, and do it ourselves.

That being said there are 3 main parts of this project:  the walkway itself, the first step, and the landing.

Walkway - currently it is just brick on sand on concrete.  The plan was to remove the brick and bring in some fresh sand to level out and compact it.  I did not think I needed any additional base with the concrete under it.  The walkway is not level from left to right, so the plan is to try and correct that with sand, is that possible or will I need to add crushed stone to the top of the concrete to make it level, then an inch of sand on top of that?  Everything I have read online is basically starting from scratch which seems like a waste here, so I would like to use the concrete that is there if possible, but wanted to get some feedback on how I would go about that.

Once complete, I was going to add the plastic trim to the outside to hold it in place, and just use regular sand between the bricks.  Not sure why you would use the poly sand vs regular sand.

First Step - this was just bricks on their side set in mortar before.  This is not level, and not high enough so I was going to remove this, take it apart, add another layer of brick below it, and reset in mortar before continuing on the upper walkway.

Landing - this is generally in good shape, but some of the mortar joints are looking rough so I was just going to grind out the joints where possible, and tuck point it.  For the spots on the side that are falling off I would just try to use the mortar to reattach.

ngiydq,Electrical panel replacement quote weirdness... or not?,"So, I bought a house very recently, and there are some big things on the to do list as the house is pretty outdated. Number 1 on the list is the fact that the house still has the original Stablok Federal Pacific electric panel. 
This panel services the original half of the house, and is located in the pantry in the kitchen (this part is important). I called a local electrical contractor here and they ballpark estimated the cost of replacement of around $1000-$1500. I think this is reasonable. 
They sent someone out to work on replacing it and immediately ran into an issue. Turns out that the dimensions of the new replacement panels are much larger than the older panel, and the stud distances in the pantry are not wide enough to fit the new one. Because of this, they want to install the new panel on another wall that is ~10 inches away. This is fine, but they redacted their estimate and instead are now estimating $2500. Does this sound reasonable? The panel is nearly in the same spot, just on an adjacent wall. I know that they will have to cut a new hole in the wall and rerun some lines and probably extend others, but is it possible that they couldn't just get a smaller electrical panel as a more 'direct replacement'? So we don't have to move it in the first place? We asked them if that's possible and they said that they don't sell smaller panels like that anymore as the industry standard has changed. I'm just hoping to get confirmation that this is all reasonable sounding. 

Thank you.

Tldr; Old panel dangerous. New panel much larger than old, so it needs to be moved so they don't do stud work. New place is still super close to old spot, but estimate jumped up by $1000. Reasonable?

They installed everything in October. I couldn't watch them 24/7 they ended up installing the inverter on the front of the house without asking me if that was okay. They also knew nothing of the glass block

Short story the supervisor came out 2 months later and discovered the air intake for our furnace was too close to where they installed the generator causing a safety issue. 

They also forced me to find a glass block person, as they wouldn't do it and agreed I would be reimbursed on the invoice of the generator.

They told me they would fix it the next week if I could take off. I did, the tech came, did not have the parts to fix it. Then left. This repeated two more times.  Wasting my time.

ngho7y,Window installer giving me the run around.,"Hey Ya'll I'm not a frequent reddit-er so go easy on me.

I have hired a company to replace all the windows in my home. They came in at a great price, are local and family owned and I thought awesome! Until, things started to get frustrating.

Firstly the install date they booked us on was pretty far out (8 weeks) but I understood that everyone and their mothers are doing home projects right now so I thought, it is what it is. However, he told me that they FREQUENTLY are able to get people in weeks before their actual install date. Great I thought. Worst case scenario, windows late spring. We singed the contract and paid 60% upfront.

They cancelled the final measurement appt. weeks later (calling the night before). I let them know that I had taken the day off work for them to come, an it was an inconvenience. They apologized and said that they would work around my schedule next time. OK thanks.

Then I didn't hear from them, for weeks....I emailed, I called, nothing...I finally after several ""hey hows it going"" type emails I was more aggressive and told them I am very concerned with the lack of communication. I got a rude call back telling me that they are very busy, and lost and installer and all that...fine. An email takes 30 seconds to write, that was my frustration.

At this point, I'm losing faith. Ok, here comes the install date. I email them to confirm, no response. I email a second time. I get a call, the story is that they are missing some part thats been on backorder for 6 weeks, so they weren't going to do my windows on the install date. He said the supplier was expecting the shipment of I don't know what the following week, and he would let me know.

A week goes by, I hear nothing. Another week goes by, nothing. I email the owner. Same story ""I actually just got off the phone with the supplier, and they are expecting the shipment next week"" at least he admits... ""but I don't know because they have said this for weeks"".

I asked if there was a plan B, since this supplier was first behind 6 weeks, then 8, now 10, and possibly beyond. What if this goes on forever? He simply said it won't, and something about he supplier merging with some other supplier and things are only going to get better.......

Am I wrong to be annoyed af? At a certain point doesn't the window manufacturer seek a new supplier to satisfy his waiting clients? And what are my legal protections should I just keep getting the run around. I really want them to do my windows because the price was really what we could afford, but at a certain point if I decide cancel can I get my money back since the contract clearly says the installation date and we are well passed that?

My husband is in construction and he has told me he has trouble getting parts too right now so I get it, I do. But I also run a business and if I can't get what I need from a supplier I figure out a way, I don't have the luxury of telling people ""maybe next week""...""maybe next week""...Indefinitely.

nghlzi,Poorly Vented Attic Kneewall. Solar attic fan?,"I have a 115 year old home. Multiple iterations of Frankenstein renovations.

The attic has been converted. There is a 6 ft knee wall with a sizable insulated area 6ft tall (sloping down to the soffit edge), about 8 ft  wide to edge of soffit, and about 40 ft long. 

The former owners/sadists effectively sealed the gap between knee wall and the gable vent at the peak of the roof. Roof is SW facing black asphalt shingles. I live in UT. Summers are deadly. AC can’t keep up.

1. Soffit is totally clogged with blown in cellulose.

I think it might just be easier to take the soffit off, clear it out, and re-install? It’s deep, buried in the crotch of the sloped roof and 40 ft of it.

Edit: Or mid roof “smart vent” venting?

2. I need actual venting. 

I’m thinking of having a roofer cut holes for box vents (at the level of the knee wall peak, not roof peak), vs solar attic fans, vs electric fans. I have no experience with any of these and am soliciting suggestions / pros / cons. Power is close by so wiring wouldn’t be impossible, could even put a switch next to the thermostat.

We are building a new privacy fence on three sides of our property- there is no existing fence on these sides. 

We live in a tight urban neighborhood which means that our new fence will butt up to our neighbors deck (there is approx 1’ between our new fence and their deck) 

Our fence is within city code, designed by a contractor ( who will also install) and will block them entirely when complete. 

We can find no information about whether we are obligated to inform these neighbors. 
My partner thinks its good form to tell them and i agree but don’t think it’s necessary - for two reasons:

1.  They rent and are not the owners of the property (we do not know or have contact info for the owner)

2.  We put up a temporary shelter/pop up tent for a little while in the yard and the neighbor complained that it was “blocking the light from her plants” 
Which it was, and which the new fence will do permanently. So i worry that she’ll cause us strife. 

Honestly- i can’t wait to be fenced in away from these folks- due to my judgmental  feelings toward their hoard/animal care/endless barking in my face etc.

Now my contractors are saying materials have doubled since then, so we’re looking at roughly $10,000 for materials. $8,000 in labor. One contractor said to expect a final bill about $20k.

- excavate and pave an under deck shed. A 10’ x 20’ shed with 7’ ceilings would be like a small 1-car garage.

- shorter wood risers/taller pylons

Situation: ceiling is fairly even, but not level. It is raked as it used to be an open porch. The rake is NOT severe enough to employ methods for installing crown on a cathedral ceiling. We have a piece that rises 3/4” over its 3’ length. 

Our plan is to install that piece first, then cope the adjoining pieces (each adjoining piece is a ~90 degree corner). The crown is paint grade, so can employ paintable caulk etc. 

Is this a good plan, or will the mismatch in visible height be obvious where the corners meet?

Or is it crappy because this non-level piece of crown will be only about 4” above a window casing that IS level (thus highlighting that the crown is raked). Should we shave off the top of the crown at one end to accommodate for part of the rise? 

It’s not large crown: about 2-1/4”

My window faces the sun as it goes down, and as i was sitting yesterday, I heard a loud noise. Sounded as if someone threw something at the window. Didn’t see any damage. But the next day, I noticed a big crack on the inside glass of this double glass window. 

Now I think it might be thermal stress, but I can’t 100% guarantee that I didn’t accidentally shut the window a little too hard at some point in the past. The sun was pretty hot and directly shining on the window. However, the crack originates right at the handle, which casts some doubt for me. 

My landlord has immediately decided he does not believe me and is sure I slammed the window. I’m really stressed, if it turns out my insurance doesn’t cover it I’m screwed.

ngdc0c,Lead Paint in Windows - No AC & Can't Replace,"We live in a 1920s home that is basically all original, and unsurprisingly, found lead paint in the window trim/windows & door trims (with the at home test kit). We have a toddler and are planning on another child soon. The paint is old and under several layers of newer/non lead paint but there are definitely places where the paint is chipping.

We're in the midst of a major renovation (mostly DIY).  Renovated area is being blocked off with plastic and we are careful about not letting the toddler play near it so less worried about what the renovation itself will trigger - we'll clean thoroughly before we move back in. We also wear P100 masks when we're in there. We've ripped out all of the trim and are planning to replace the doors. Unfortunately, we can't afford to replace the windows (multiple quotes we've gotten are in the $75Kish range, we live in a VHCOL area).

That might be fine (I hear lead is fine if you leave it be) except that we also don't have air conditioning, and we live in a part of the country where it does get quite hot in the summer. It's not really feasible to never open the windows. Our toddler has had his lead levels checked and so far they're fine.

While we plan to replace the windows eventually, we won't be able to in the near term. As a stopgap solution, we were planning on replacing the existing window trim (obviously) and painting over the sills/sashes/rails as much as we can. We know that's not a perfect plan given that windows opening and closing will create friction and potentially stir up dust.  We also could buy window ACs for every room in the house (though I shudder to think about our energy bills) so that we don't have to open the windows. Other creative ideas?

I recently had to deal with a failing wax ring under a toilet on hardwood floor, and was able to notice the problem quickly because the floorboards started warping, but now I'm scarred and am worried about the non-wood floor toilets in my house....how do I know they're not leaking too?

In particular, one of the bathrooms with tile has a toilet that was rocking side to side prior to last week, and I noticed one of the bolts was loose. I tightened it and it seems fine now. I'm worried though that perhaps the seal is broken. There's no standing water or anything on the tile, but one area looks maybe wet. When I feel it though or try to put TP there to see if it can be soaked up, it feels greasy, not wet, and is maybe slightly yellow--there is radiant heat, so I thought maybe that's melted wax, but the heating stops short of the toilet.  Should I just pull this toilet up too and replace the seal as precaution? Or is there something I can do short of that to confirm the problem (or lack thereof)?

ngampg,Looking for confirmation on pouring concrete bathroom floor,"Hey everyone,

A bit of context first, I live in Germany, and my house has a concrete structure. We ripped out most of everything that was in it, and we are building back up now. We will have in-floor heating installed through a method that digs a trench into the concrete floor, where the piping is laid and then covered.

I'll be putting a new layer of screet in my bathroom next week to replace what was taken out during the renovations, and to provide the surface that the in-floor heating trench will be dug into.

The measurements I have of what needs to be filled is 187cm x 177cm x 6cm deep. That gives me .199 m3, or 199L to be filled. The screed I'm using is in 30kg bags, and works out to about 15L final product each, meaning I would need 13.2 bags, 14 or even 15 for good measure. 1st question, do those numbers seem right?

My intended method is to build a plywood wall, to keep the screed away from where the bathtub will be placed. Once that is boxed off, I'll take my final height from the hallway floor, measure up 1m, use a laser level to transfer that height to the bathroom, and mark the height + 1m around the room, to measure down from to get my final surface height.

I'll use a straight 2x4 to level out the screed in the middle once I have the right height around the edges, and can check my height with a marked stick and the laser level. I'll work the screed in batches, as I only have about 40 min to work with it once it's wet.
2nd question, does that sound like a workable approach? I'm doing it on my own, and have about a 5 hour window in the day to do it all. It needs to be poured then, so it is set enough for when the company comes to dig the trench for the in-floor heating.

I originally planned this spring to remove the top ply, and finish the WRC siding up to the soffit to give it a more uniform look and finish. However.... the lumber shortages have not just resulted in higher prices. I literally cannot even get cedar lap siding locally anymore.

I leave the vent/ceiling fan on pretty much 24/7 but it barely makes a difference. I ordered new floor drains with covers as well and they are arriving in a few days. If that still doesn’t work I don’t know what to do anymore...

ng8tno,Huge temperature variations throughout the house - tips to equalize?,"I live in Ontario and we rent our house, so doing actual permanent changes to the home isn't possible. But I'm looking for ways to potentially increase our comfort through other means. To help visualize, we have a 2 bedroom house with a basement. There are three floors: the basement, the main level and the bedrooms above that. The thermostat is on the main level and currently set to 23C. All AC vents and returns in the house are open.

Right now it's about 27C outside and we have our AC running to make the main level comfortable. Our basement (where I have my desk for WFH) is frigid cold, the main level is a good temperature, but the bedrooms are still way too hot, even during night time.

So first the basement: will there be any issue shutting off all of the AC vents in the basement and leaving the return that's down there open? In my head this would stop the AC from cooling the basement and leave more cool air for the main level and bedrooms.

And next the master bedroom: it is built above our open porch and I suspect there is very little insulation between the floor and the outside world, because in the winter the bedroom is freezing cold and in the summer it's boiling hot. What can we do to improve the comfort in this room if it's just a case of really poor floor insulation?

I had mini-natural stone mesh backed tile installed around my fireplace and I’m really not pleased with the result. 

There are large gaps, almost all the joints of the tiles are visible, and there is a slight wave to the tile. I did replace drywall with cement board prior to install (at the installer’s request) and leveled best as possible with the stone surround (which was not level) but assumed the installer could balance with thinset. 

I will be speaking with my installer and want to solidify two things first:

1) The wave could/should have been accounted for in the install process. If it wasn’t possible to do so, we should have had a discussion and remediated prior to installation. Am I crazy here?

2) Is this type of tile able to be grouted to close the gapping and create a uniform look?

I live alone and my water usage isn't much. 2) I can replace a tank water by myself with some help from a friend to move the tanks. 3) I'd love to get rid to the ugly tank and have a little more space in the laundry room. 4) If I go with a tankless heater, I will need a professional to install it adding to the cost overall. 

The tank heater that I'm looking at has a 6 year warranty and is less than $500. The tankless heater is about $600, plus venting, updating gas line, and professional install. I'm estimating all in about $1000. Also I can have a tank hot water heater this weekend, but tankless is probably going to take a week or more to get ordered and installed.

nghk78,Path Forward,"This post is going to be a rant/relief for me so appreciate you reading it.

My husband and I have $46K in student loan debt between the two of us. This was originally higher. When we met in 2010:

* Husband had a $12K private student loan with a 9.25% interest rate that he hadn't made that much of a dent on when we met.
* Husband had another 2x Department of Education loans equating to $20K with a 6.625% interest rate.
* I have 2x Department of Education loans that started their payment cycle in 2012 that equated to a little over $45K with a 6.875% interest rate. 

This is **$77K**. We have been able to not even get to half of it paid off since we have been together. We don't qualify for any forgiveness (though my husband can qualify for the public service forgiveness in 3 years) and we're not holding out any hope for Biden or congress to do anything.

We have been taking advantage of the COVID forbearance and throwing money at the principal for the Dept of ED loans. We wiped out the remaining balance of the private student loan (about $11K) since that was still collecting interest at the beginning of May. We were able to do that because we have been building a really healthy savings account and decided to wipe it.

We have been itching to buy a house. We finally decided as to where at the beginning of the month (after months of wavering on a location) so we started seriously exploring. We knew our budget and knew what we could put as a down payment, provide us with a financial cushion, and make the required student loan payments. We found a place that we **loved** and were about to make an offer until we ran the numbers and realized that it wasn't going to make sense to do it. We were actually going to take advantage of our state's SmartBuy program for first-time homebuyers to wipe out $30K of our student loan debt (free money, right?). Well, once we did the math, it was going to cost us more per month to utilize the state's plan because they were requiring a higher interest rate to wipe the student loans as opposed to getting a conventional mortgage with a lower interest rate. We backed out of the deal and never made an offer because we knew that while we could pay the mortgage every month, we would have to decrease our contribution to investments, retirements, savings, etc, but still need to pay almost $500/month in student loans. So we backed out.

*NOTE: You're might be wondering how we couldn't afford another $500/month on the mortgage and NOT cut into investment and retirement accounts contributions? The place we were looking at was a condo with a $438/month HOA. THAT was the problem. If the HOA wasn't there, we would have been fine.*

We were devasted. The one place we looked at was in the area that we wanted and we knew we couldn't take the risk because what we realized was that our student loans were what was in the way. If we didn't have the student loan payment, we would be able to afford the place we were looking at and be perfectly fine.

What you don't realize is that as you pay on your student loans monthly, they are always just there in the background but so long as you're paying and are able to budget for it while still being able to live, they're not really a nuance -- just annoying. But when you want to do something big, like buy a permanent home, they are **right there** and smack you in the face **hard**.

We have been working with a financial advisor since the beginning of the year and he's been able to invest in some of the money and we have seen some returns but not much (slow growth). I reached out to him to explain what we ran into and asked for his advice. He, honestly, told me to clear the account with him because though we didn't have much with him and until we pay off the student loans, this was going to be a recurring issue. So take advantage of the no-interest now, pay down what you can, and come back in 12-18 months when the stock market goes through its cycle of ups and downs. I really appreciated his honesty. While we want a healthy investment as another way to fund our future retirement, we can't have the future we want if we can't get rid of the student loans that we have had haunting us both for over a decade.

After this advice, we have decided to:

* Wipe our investment account, which is only $20K put it towards my 2x student loans while it's in forbearance since it has the higher interest rate and higher monthly payment;
* Take the monthly recurring deposits we were putting into the investment account and direct them to student loans (another $1K per month);
* At the end of September, evaluate how much extra we want to put towards my husband's loan from savings (since he got $11K to pay off the private in May, he'll still get some large payment -- just not $20K);
* Still contribute the same amounts that we have to retirement and savings

Our original plan over 6 months (starting from April 2021 to September 2021) was to have an aggressive goal of getting the loans down to $30K; this will get us under $20K in total. At the end of September, when interest rates will probably come back, we'll evaluate how much to contribute monthly to payments (probably keep it at the $1K or increase it slightly to offset the accrued interest).

While I hate that I have to wipe my investment account after not even 5 months, I feel a sense of relief knowing while I could keep it and continue to see gains and losses from investments, my husband and I will never be able to get a permanent home and build equity if we have these damn student loans constantly following us.

So while we won't have all of them paid off during the forbearance, at least it's a step in the right direction. I **hope** that by my husband's next birthday (April 24th), we will have all, if not, almost all of the student loans paid off while continuing to have a healthy savings account, and be in a much better situation to look for our future home.

I have never had so much anxiety about buying a house as I have over the past 3 weeks and then coming to the realization that we simply cannot afford it. While I know there are folks out there that will buy houses with bad credit, have much higher monthly payments, and much more debt, I never want to put myself or my husband in that situation to not be able to pay our student loans and/or mortgage. If we can't do either, then we clearly did not prepare well enough.

This whole house buying exercise really put things into perspective of how much student loans are such a drain on students that want to better themselves to receive an education in something they are passionate about and contribute to society with this newly obtained knowledge and skillset. I want everyone to be able to receive the same education my husband and I have been fortunate enough to receive and not drown in debt that follows them for decades. It really shows how our education system is severely overpriced with little ROI. 

I hope that congress does something for those drowning in debt. It will help stimulate our economy significantly, especially as we dig ourselves out of the downward spiral caused by COVID.

To those that stuck this far to read this, thank you. I really need to write this out - it was cathartic. I hope those that are struggling to handle these awful payments find relief soon. No one should be faced with such a large price tag to receive an education.",9,1,StudentLoans,7416

We’ve lived in the property for about 3 years and never had this issue until about month ago. 

When we turn on our central air, there is a *horrid* stench. The best I could compare it to would be rotten pickled eggs - it’s terrible. 

This only seems to occur when the AC is running. Not the heat (which is gas). The smell is only concentrated in the main living area with the most strongest scent coming from near our front door which opens directly into the living room from a deck. We really don’t notice it in other rooms of the home. 

We initially thought maybe the filter needed replaced - which we did. This helped for maybe 2-3 days but the smell is back. 

We unscrewed the vent where the smell is the strongest and stuck our phones inside to try and see if we could notice anything in the vent - we found nothing within what our phones could view. 

The only things I can think of are that maybe the unit needs cleaned? Or maybe something died below our deck that is somehow being pulled into the unit? Is it even possible something is in the ductwork?

ngvmuh,How to make a sump system more reliable?,"I have two pumps in my sump.  Saved me tonight.

Main sump just stopped working.  Battery sump worked, but didn't sound it's alarm.  Or the water climbed to 1/2"" from the lip and t he main one ran.

Something about the change of sound woke me and I found the water 3"" from the lip.

Float said that the battery one should work.  Ran it manually.  Pump works.  At this point I'm not quite sure what happened.

I keep a spare pump on a 70 chunk of black poly pipe.  dropped it into the sump ran the line out the patio door and plugged it in. Pulled the old pump, so that it's float wouldn't interfere.

I'm writing this while listening to it cycle every 3 minutes.  (We had 1.2 inches of rain yesterday, on ground already soggy.

This pump is less than 5 years old.  But sump pumps here lead an active life.  It  has runs year round for the last two years, as has our intermittent creek.  Much of the winter it runs only once a day.  In spring run off season it can run as often as every 80 seconds.  Right now it's running about every 3 minutes.

I'd like a more reliable system, and one that I can run in duplex.  From my research pedastal pumps are the least reliable.  The switch goes. The bearings go.  The floating ball switches are supposed to be good for very long periods.  But running two of them in an 18"" confined space is problematic.  I don't know right now if it is the switch or the pump

Pressure switches designed to work with small differences don't seem to be common. A 1 foot water level difference is about 1/2 psi. And in practice you want it adjust it to a finer level than that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So questions:

Q1:  What do I look for in a reliable sump pump?  Or do I just replace it every 2 years broken or not?

Q2:  How do I keep multiple pumps in a small sump?  (I was thinking of using a small jet pump if I could figure out how to maintain the prime.  The sump some years has actually dried out.)

Q3: Anyone know of a a type of water level switch that doesn't take up as much room, or have the potential to tangle?

Q4:  References for sump design?

Q5: Recommendations for a really LOUD water alarm.  I've tried a couple and they produce a very shrill sound that can't be heard 2 rooms away.

ngv0bo,So...I effed up. How do I tackle this roach problem and correct my mistake?,"I hope this is the right place for my questions. I recently moved into an apartment and noticed a few roaches in 20 minutes on the first night. Notified the landlords and they had pest “control” come out, who apparently comes out every 2 months. I’m 99% sure they’re ineffective and keep them down to a minimal, but I want all roaches GONE. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to break my lease since they’re not violating any landlord laws, and my neighbors will continue to be unhygienic. (I peeped some things.)

So first...my problem:

First day I googled stuff and panic-bought Advion. I applied it directly to crevices throughout my apartment (mostly in kitchen and bathroom) because I have pets. But apparently I’m not supposed to apply it directly in cracks because it needs to be replaced? If that’s the case, do I just scrape it out or is it okay if it just dries in there? 

Second: 

I read about Bengal Roach Killer and want to purchase some to use instead of Advion since it’s also an IGR (destroys their reproductive cycle). Would it be okay to use with Advion already in place?

Third:

The caulk job is legit terrible. It seemed normal to me because I’m used to see this in the hood, but after research this isn’t normal. I wish I knew more about this before deciding to move in, but being a young adult in my first apartment, I didn’t know all the fine details. If I can, I want to do the caulking myself. So considering the fact that I used Advion in the crevices, is it a bad idea to caulk with the Advion in place? Also, should I use Bengal Roach Killer before or after caulking?

ngut91,Wanting to add a landscaped area to tile but concerns about effect on flooding,"https://imgur.com/g2ab4c6

https://imgur.com/3oimkzR

Hello everyone.

I live in a townhouse that doesn’t have any grass. The front and back are tiled but the back is strictly a utility area. I want to covert 1/2 of the front into a landscaped area so my kids can have a place to play and to have something nice to look at. I have included a diagram of what I would like to do but I have some concerns because whenever we get heavy prolonged rain the front and back flood.

As you may see in the photo, the front is more or less enclosed in concrete walls, its also concrete to right of the car. The only inlet and outlet is the front gate. 

When we get heavy rains, the street outside floods and the water level rises above that opening (circled in red). Once it does that, the water inside has no where to go but forward towards our house which is just a wall of slide glass doors. It’s not all disaster though because the the water only accumulates to right side of the support column because the left side is slightly higher. Both sides have bilge pumps installed and in the rare circumstance that the water rises high enough we block the sliding doors with sand bags. Water has not gotten inside the house but its come close a couple of times. The street floods 4-5 times a year.

What I am wondering is that if I do the following ( and as shown in the diagram), will it make my problem worse or will it possibly help:

The green area will be artificial grass that will just be placed on the tile with no adhesion. It will be held in place by concrete planters and bricks place on the edges of the grass. 

The white area will be a small Japanese Garden. The border will be white bricks and concrete planters. I am going to lay the bricks sideways so the holes in the brick can be used as drainage so the bricks will create a border around 7cm tall. On one side of the border, the planters will make up part of the border. They are 30cm tall and 100cm long. 

Inside of the border will be filled with a 6cm layer of gravel or small river rock pebbles to match what we seen in Japanese rock gardens. I will add some large rocks and plants and also a centerpiece Bonsai in the middle of the garden.

So will adding the landscaping help with managing the flow of the water or will it hurt it?",0,0,HomeImprovement,2295

I removed it and found that drywall seems to be attached to a thin ply.  Which was holding the electrical box to the ceiling.  I bought a metal ceiling brace and box kit to install the ceiling fan.  It is intended to connect to the joists and hold the weight of the fan but when I put it into the ceiling there were no joists to attach to at 16” or 24”.  I tried to run it both ways (even though it didn’t make sense that they ran the other way) but no luck.  There is no attic or way to see in there.  I’m stuck.,4,0,HomeImprovement,804
ngq07q,"How to handle Chainlink fence with a short, small hill.","I'm going to put up a chain link fence in a couple weeks, and I'm not sure how to go about the short, small hill right up against the house.  The slope is only about 3 foot long and maybe a foot high at most, but it's definitely higher and it runs the entire length of the house.   The solutions I'd found online include placing another terminal post at the bottom of the hill and cutting a bias in the fence and putting another tension bar.  I was planning on only having terminal posts on corners and the gate and running the fabric straight through corner to corner, so an extra terminal post throws that off.  Another solution was to just bury the bottom of the fence and keep the top completely straight.  I went for a 5 foot fence, so even leaving 4 foot would still be plenty, but I didn't know if that was a good idea or not.  I also was planning on putting the gate right against the house on one side of the house, so I obviously can't just bury bottom of that.

ngoika,Vinyl under flooring?,"I don’t know if this is a thing. For context, I’m a newish homeowner trying to finish a basement that has always had seeping problems. Last year I paid for waterproofing and the installation of a sump pump in a space that never had one.

I’ve been preparing to put flooring down soon, but the spring rains have started and to my dismay (considering the enormous expense), while the issue isn’t as bad, the basement is anything but “waterproofed”. There is no standing water but the concrete flooring is darkening with moisture in the usual trouble spots even though the sump has been working, and I imagine it’ll only get worse as we’re only on day 2 of a 2-week deluge.

My question is: when laying down flooring, can you put a layer of vinyl underneath to keep the water out? My walls have vinyl sheets to direct water down into the gutter system, so I’m picturing something like that: sheets of vinyl between the concrete floor and whatever laminate I put down.

My income is not high, which is why finding water in my basement after so much money spent is making me desperate to find something that’ll stop this so I can just finish the dang space.

Update: I was already bringing the installation company in to look at the moisture leaks before I posted here (and they agree they need to fix a couple of issues!) but I appreciate the advice and will be getting additional subflooring anti-moisture material to double down on no water! They’re pretty confident the moisture is because the installation crew didn’t take out walls and connect the vinyl around them, instead for some reason cutting the vinyl to follow the walls instead..",8,1,HomeImprovement,1639

It turns out that AT&T has been running fibre throughout my neighborhood and damaged my underground electrical connection, which is in my neighbor's back yard. I got a quote from the electrician to fix it and he quoted me $3,600 to run a new underground about 100ft....so $36 per square foot. I'm hoping I can find the AT&T subcontractor who did this and hold them responsible, but from all I've read, that seems like a long shot. I'm not even sure where to begin. My questions are the following:

1.) Does $3,600 sound reasonable to run a new underground connection 100 ft?  
2.) Do I need to have the entire thing re-run? Isn't it possible to just have the connection repaired at the broken spot instead?

Hi Everyone,

Our front porch leaks water into the basement when it gets wet. I suspected that there was no seal behind the vinyl siding and between the concrete step and house wood. I tore into one side and confirmed my findings. It's happening on both sides of the porch but wanted to take one side apart first for inspection. The structural wood seems to mostly ok. 

I'll need to repair both sides and possibly replace the decorative wood below the front storm door so that I can get a solid seal around the whole step. 

I want to seal this the best way possible and replace at least 1 double row of siding on both sides of the porch and replace the decorative wood. Basically creating a nice seal around the step against the house. 

I was thinking some kind of caulk then some some sort of metal flashing and then reinstalling the siding. 

I'd love some thoughts if possible and maybe some suggestions on the right caulk to use or other suggestions. We are in Central Ohio so our winters are cold if that helps anything. 

[Here is an album of pics. ](https://imgur.com/a/qgd748L)

Thank you all for any help in advance.

Edit: another idea I had was to get the seal in place and instead of metal flashing, maybe use some of the vinyl outdoor mounding on top of the house wood to serve as a water barrier as well as not having to bring the siding all the way back down.",0,1,HomeImprovement,1379

ngkidb,Help! Deck joist rot,"[https://imgur.com/a/0B94aUt](https://imgur.com/a/0B94aUt)

  

Help, I don’t know what step to take.

We’ve been in our house 6 years now, don’t know how long the deck has been here but it’s at least 12 years old.  The deck boards have always been in a bad state, some warping and cupping, a lot of severe checking, and even some punkiness in some of the boards. The footings, post, and joists always looked in a great state so I thought when the time comes I would just replace the deck boards a few at a time as needed.

However, I noticed when looking carefully at some of the wider seams where I can see the joist, some of them seemed to have checks going across the top, and seemed punky when pressing with screwdriver. So today I decide to expose one of these to see how bad, and it turns out quite bad:

It seems that over time water has infiltrated through the nail holes (nails are all rusted badly) and deposited inside the joists, and have rotted them from the inside like a cavity. As you can see I can dig out all this rich compost-like rot, and this rot goes about 2-3 inches into the 2x8 joist. The outer ½ inch on either side of the rot is surprisingly intact. It’s like an ice cream sandwich.

I had no idea the rot would be this bad. I would say only 1 out of 20 ‘seams’ would have this type of punkiness, the others seem OK when poking from the top with screwdriver, but who knows what is under the surface.

A few questions.

1) Can this be DIY salvaged? I had originally planned to dig out the punk and fill with wood epoxy but I don’t know if that is a valid option, seeing how deep the rot goes. I’m slightly below average handy.

2) Assuming that the posts and footings are OK, can this be subjected to ‘major repair’ by professionals, where they replace the rotten joists and boards? Or would this be a complete ‘tear down and build new’ job?

3) In either case, any rough thoughts on how much I can expect to have to pay? The deck is quite large, roughly about 25 feet by 20 feet, with some irregular shapes.

4) How could this have been prevented? Deck joist tape? Caulk around nail holes?

I should note that the deck is only 3 feet off the ground so I am not majorly concerned about it falling out from under our feet and us getting injured. You would NOT guess that this deck has problems, it is VERY solid to walk around on.",3,1,HomeImprovement,2356

ngkgz1,Air test turned up one single asbestos fiber,"I recently had work done on my house. The contractor got dust everywhere. The work was done in the basement.

A professional company came and did air pumps for a few hours and the results in the basement showed no asbestos in the air, nothing   in two other areas but did find one single fiber in the last area tested on the second floor. One fiber is well below the limit to do anything about but I can't help but wonder if there's asbestos lurking somewhere or if it blew in from somewhere or was carried in somehow. Under the floorboards near the room where this testing location was has some pipes. The floor boards are 100 years old and have lots of openings which is how I know what they look like. From what I can tell there is no insulation on them but I'm not an expert. I wonder if it did it could have made it's way through a floor board crack and if so should I be worried about more exposure. We will actually be covering those floors with new hardwood in a few weeks. My other thought was it blew in from the condemned house about  30 feet away which has no internal walls and all the windows open (if there an actual pane still) and had a ton of insane diy work.

nggdol,Notify neighbor of new fence?,"Hello! 

We are building a new privacy fence on three sides of our property- there is no existing fence on these sides. 

We live in a tight urban neighborhood which means that our new fence will butt up to our neighbors deck (there is approx 1’ between our new fence and their deck) 

Our fence is within city code, designed by a contractor ( who will also install) and will block them entirely when complete. 

We can find no information about whether we are obligated to inform these neighbors. 
My partner thinks its good form to tell them and i agree but don’t think it’s necessary - for two reasons:

1.  They rent and are not the owners of the property (we do not know or have contact info for the owner)

2.  We put up a temporary shelter/pop up tent for a little while in the yard and the neighbor complained that it was “blocking the light from her plants” 
Which it was, and which the new fence will do permanently. So i worry that she’ll cause us strife. 

Honestly- i can’t wait to be fenced in away from these folks- due to my judgmental  feelings toward their hoard/animal care/endless barking in my face etc. 

So obviously i’m biased. 

Reddit- do we have an obligation to inform the tenants next door about our impending privacy fence?


EDIT: wow- this is touching a lot of folks right in the sweet spot- 

REGARDING THE FOLLOWING:

1. There is no HOA, permitting or city requirements for this type of fence, its height, or our property type (residential) we are entirely within our rights to build it with out needing approval from the city or county. 

2. Regarding the property line- we did not have it surveyed- we were actually unable to find someone to do such a “small scale” job in our rapidly gentrifying area. However- it is not a requirement- it was more of a “lets be really sure” type scenario. We used the records with the city to verify our basic perimeter and are using it. 
We felt comfortable doing this as the neighbors deck is also directly on the line so it’s anyones guess who is on each others property. In fact- we are opting to leave this 1’ foot of space so that they have some room to repair said deck if needed (its needed) we felt that if the owner of the rental had concern- they could pay for the survey which could likely result in their deck being in the wrong. Also- we have a small shed on this same line and this has not been brought up to us as a line violation. 

3. RENTERS ARE THE SAME VALUE AS ALL HUMANS 

i did not mean to diminish renters- more so- they are likely to move out (again- expensive city) and 
over correcting to their preference (flower light and whatnot) is a habit we are trying to avoid. People pleasers here. 

4. And finally- we are still unsure of our next steps but want to thank everyone for their input- there are good bits here that we didn’t think about as we are blinded by the ever present shrill barking of one chihuahua and the owner screaming at it to shut up.",186,190,HomeImprovement,2952

1. Make all federal student loans interest and fee free.

2. Limit loan offers to the following for which the cost is provided by the school.

	a. Tuition

	b. Room and Board

	c. Meal Plan

3. Student loan payments

	a. Full payment tax is deductible and fully refundable.

	b. Automatic payroll and retirement plan/pension payments deduction of mandatory 10% until loan is satisfied.

	c. Additional payments can be made with after tax money and deducted via the tax return.   

	d. No payments due while unemployed.  

	e. Payments can’t be taken from social security and SSI (disability payments).

	f. Allow employers to contribute towards student loan payments as a fringe benefits as an nontaxable benefit.  

4. Bankruptcy treatment

	a. No changes from the current law.  

5. Refinance

	a. Loans would need to be refinanced into this plan. Private loans and Federal loans can be re-financed into this plan.  

Reasoning for the possible critiques of the plan above.  

1. Why should Student loans be interest free? They should pay interest like everyone else. Why should they get a tax deduction on the full payments.  

 We need an incentive for people to participate in the plan. This plan forces tax payer to carry the burden of the interest rate and the tax deductions.  At the currently mentioned $1.5 Trillion and assuming an APR of 2.2% and only the mandatory 10% payroll deduction would be $370.1 billion while resulting in $308.43 billion in payments. This could payoff the original principle within 5 years. I acknowledge that these calculations are simplistic and that a department like the CBO would have more refined cost and benefit analysis. But, this would be a much easier pill to swallow than loan forgiveness. My hope would be that after the loans are at a more manageable level that it would kept to properly fund a abysmally funded k-12 and public college education system. That would reduce the need for future students to take out student loans. Thoughts, concerns, suggestions?  

Calculations

Total cost = principle \* interest rate + median household income \* 10% \* typical federal effective tax rate \* number of people with student loans.

Total cost = $1.5 Trillion \* .022 + $69k \*.10 \* .13 \* 44.7 million

Total cost = $330 billion + $40.1 billion

Total cost = $370.1 billion on the first year.",14,0,StudentLoans,2385

nghk78,Path Forward,"TL;DR: My story about student loans, how they suck, and don’t wish them on anyone. 

This post is going to be a rant/relief for me so appreciate you reading it.

My husband and I have $46K in student loan debt between the two of us. This was originally higher. When we met in 2010:

* Husband had a $12K private student loan with a 9.25% interest rate that he hadn't made that much of a dent on when we met.
* Husband had another 2x Department of Education loans equating to $20K with a 6.625% interest rate.
* I have 2x Department of Education loans that started their payment cycle in 2012 that equated to a little over $45K with a 6.875% interest rate. 

This is **$77K**. We have been able to not even get to half of it paid off since we have been together. We don't qualify for any forgiveness (though my husband can qualify for the public service forgiveness in 3 years) and we're not holding out any hope for Biden or congress to do anything.

We have been taking advantage of the COVID forbearance and throwing money at the principal for the Dept of ED loans. We wiped out the remaining balance of the private student loan (about $11K) since that was still collecting interest at the beginning of May. We were able to do that because we have been building a really healthy savings account and decided to wipe it.

We have been itching to buy a house. We finally decided as to where at the beginning of the month (after months of wavering on a location) so we started seriously exploring. We knew our budget and knew what we could put as a down payment, provide us with a financial cushion, and make the required student loan payments. We found a place that we **loved** and were about to make an offer until we ran the numbers and realized that it wasn't going to make sense to do it. We were actually going to take advantage of our state's SmartBuy program for first-time homebuyers to wipe out $30K of our student loan debt (free money, right?). Well, once we did the math, it was going to cost us more per month to utilize the state's plan because they were requiring a higher interest rate to wipe the student loans as opposed to getting a conventional mortgage with a lower interest rate. We backed out of the deal and never made an offer because we knew that while we could pay the mortgage every month, we would have to decrease our contribution to investments, retirements, savings, etc, but still need to pay almost $500/month in student loans. So we backed out.

*NOTE: You're might be wondering how we couldn't afford another $500/month on the mortgage and NOT cut into investment and retirement accounts contributions? The place we were looking at was a condo with a $438/month HOA. THAT was the problem. If the HOA wasn't there, we would have been fine.*

We were devasted. The one place we looked at was in the area that we wanted and we knew we couldn't take the risk because what we realized was that our student loans were what was in the way. If we didn't have the student loan payment, we would be able to afford the place we were looking at and be perfectly fine.

What you don't realize is that as you pay on your student loans monthly, they are always just there in the background but so long as you're paying and are able to budget for it while still being able to live, they're not really a nuance -- just annoying. But when you want to do something big, like buy a permanent home, they are **right there** and smack you in the face **hard**.

We have been working with a financial advisor since the beginning of the year and he's been able to invest in some of the money and we have seen some returns but not much (slow growth). I reached out to him to explain what we ran into and asked for his advice. He, honestly, told me to clear the account with him because though we didn't have much with him and until we pay off the student loans, this was going to be a recurring issue. So take advantage of the no-interest now, pay down what you can, and come back in 12-18 months when the stock market goes through its cycle of ups and downs. I really appreciated his honesty. While we want a healthy investment as another way to fund our future retirement, we can't have the future we want if we can't get rid of the student loans that we have had haunting us both for over a decade.

After this advice, we have decided to:

* Wipe our investment account, which is only $20K put it towards my 2x student loans while it's in forbearance since it has the higher interest rate and higher monthly payment;
* Take the monthly recurring deposits we were putting into the investment account and direct them to student loans (another $1K per month);
* At the end of September, evaluate how much extra we want to put towards my husband's loan from savings (since he got $11K to pay off the private in May, he'll still get some large payment -- just not $20K);
* Still contribute the same amounts that we have to retirement and savings

Our original plan over 6 months (starting from April 2021 to September 2021) was to have an aggressive goal of getting the loans down to $30K; this will get us under $20K in total. At the end of September, when interest rates will probably come back, we'll evaluate how much to contribute monthly to payments (probably keep it at the $1K or increase it slightly to offset the accrued interest).

While I hate that I have to wipe my investment account after not even 5 months, I feel a sense of relief knowing while I could keep it and continue to see gains and losses from investments, my husband and I will never be able to get a permanent home and build equity if we have these damn student loans constantly following us.

So while we won't have all of them paid off during the forbearance, at least it's a step in the right direction. I **hope** that by my husband's next birthday (April 24th), we will have all, if not, almost all of the student loans paid off while continuing to have a healthy savings account, and be in a much better situation to look for our future home.

I have never had so much anxiety about buying a house as I have over the past 3 weeks and then coming to the realization that we simply cannot afford it. While I know there are folks out there that will buy houses with bad credit, have much higher monthly payments, and much more debt, I never want to put myself or my husband in that situation to not be able to pay our student loans and/or mortgage. If we can't do either, then we clearly did not prepare well enough.

This whole house buying exercise really put things into perspective of how much student loans are such a drain on students that want to better themselves to receive an education in something they are passionate about and contribute to society with this newly obtained knowledge and skillset. I want everyone to be able to receive the same education my husband and I have been fortunate enough to receive and not drown in debt that follows them for decades. It really shows how our education system is severely overpriced with little ROI. 

I hope that congress does something for those drowning in debt. It will help stimulate our economy significantly, especially as we dig ourselves out of the downward spiral caused by COVID.

To those that stuck this far to read this, thank you. I really need to write this out - it was cathartic. I hope those that are struggling to handle these awful payments find relief soon. No one should be faced with such a large price tag to receive an education.",13,5,StudentLoans,7501
nhfqv3,Update: Water filter clogging in under 2 weeks.,"See post history for previous post about my new-to-me house’s water filter clogging with iron very quickly. 

I had a water test done which included a flow test to determine if I had enough gpm for a backwash filter. My system miserably failed the flow test; once the pressure tank volume dissipated, flow went to almost 0. Pro recommended replacing well pump, as it is likely plugged up. So I went ahead and had them change it. 

I searched for 2 weekends for the buried well head, unsuccessfully. They found it fairly quickly and changed it out. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/PjQTYRe

After replacement, the water quality was terrible- see picture in Imgur link. I received instructions on flushing the well out with the hose for 20min at a time, with 30min in between. After about a day, the water was coming out pretty clear, but would occasionally turn back to the dirty water for a few min. 

After the periods of dirty water subsided, along with my need to shower, I decided to turn on the water to the house, with a fresh filter. That was yesterday, and I have been through 3 filters already, and also periodically flushing with the hose when I have time. 

Flow is great, but I am afraid to open the valve too much during my flushes because that is when it seems to pick up the nasty water. I will continue this for a while, and then look into a backwash filter because the water quality will never be perfect. 

If anyone is still reading, I could use some further advice on 2 topics:
- when I change the filter, even with properly shutting water off, etc., I still get a few min worth of unfiltered looking water from every tap in the house after new filter is installed. Sometimes quite dirty. Is there residue in the pipes that get unsettled when I change the filter?

-when i install a backwash filter, where should I put the discharge line? I don’t want to put it to septic. Should I make a dry well? There is a 1” pipe going out of the house, that is connected to nothing inside. I suspect it was connected to the old water softener given its location and position. Maybe I can just hook it up there and make sure it flows ok? The recently installed softener discharges to septic, and I want to move that to the same system that I put the filter to.

First is the measurement - I'm not sure which measurement is correct.  I've attached a picture.  The measurement for A is 35"" wide by 80"" height.  If I take it at B, it's 36""x 80"".  However for B, the top horizontal wooden bar doesn't extend all the way to the front edge of the trim so the storm door would not be able to tuck underneath it.  Also, I install at the A location, the storm door won't open past 90deg. 

I went to Home Depot and they had an outside company come and take measurements.  They measured and said I would need a 32.5"" wide storm door and it would need to be custom made.  It would cost $500 with $300 installation.  That didn't make sense to me.   Then I tried the thumbtack app and one of the local contractors quoted me $1500 for storm door and screen door.  Didn't even come by to take measurements.  I called a person who specializes in door and window installation and he quoted me $800-$1000 for storm door and installation.

I need advice on how to reduce the noise coming from outside my window. There is an old A/C unit outside and it is very loud.

I'll have to live here for at least some time, so I need to do something about the noise.

He assured me everything looked great, but as it turns out he didn’t check the ductwork throughout the attic and only checked the fittings on the actual furnace (don’t think this was intentional, sounds more like a miscommunication and he didn’t understand I wanted all the vent locations checked from the attic). We just had to have the old insulation removed, and new stuff blown in, and I’ve noticed there is insulation in all of my vents now...so obviously it’s not sealed up there.

**LG advantage (in order that matters to me):**

* ""Auto Cleaning Condenser"" function -- couldn't find any reviews on this feature, but if it actually less maintenance on daily basis, that'd a huge plus for me.
* $400 cheaper
* WIFI feature -- not sure how helpful this is. any has any experience with it?

**Remaining questions:**

* How are customer service/repair options for Miele vs LG in New York area? (in terms of cost and availability)
* LG seems to have 240v option -- does this mean better performance in general?
* While people seem to love Miele's product quality/reliability, LG seems excellent too -- is this difference negligible?

nh9scm,"Questionable attic knockouts, Ill-made ridge vents, and lack of air flow?","https://imgur.com/a/3JblHRW

Recently did some attic work in my daughter’s house in regards to insulation and saw several items of concern. I tried contacting local architects, energy auditors, and roofers, and none of them were able to assist.


The house has three separate attic/roof structures, and the mspaint drawing is a side view of just one of the side rooms with a lofted ceiling.


Firstly - In this room is a fireplace that is centered on the back wall, the fireplace and chimney are framed externally of the house through a chase that goes the whole height of the house plus roof clearance. There is a rock façade going up the length of the lofted wall. Within the attic there is a knockout (red square) in to that chase that goes down pretty much the whole length down to the fireplace. Aside from the lack of insulation that may or may not be between the room’s osb and rock, is there any reason or concern there is a giant knockout connecting the room and attic?


Secondly - The roof is ridge vented, but whomever did the shingling did not cut away the felt paper between attic and vent, so essentially there is no vent. Is there any feasible reason why this was done (or not done)?


Thirdly - At some point, whether it was previous owner, roofers, builder, who knows, they knocked holes in to the soffits at each external facing side (red circle). The soffits on the roofs run around all sides of the roof, so essentially, I suppose this hole is acting like a vent cap of some sort. Is there any feasible reason why this was done?


The attic does have proper blown-in insulation and baffles, but there is a noted lack of air movement in the attic, causing the house to be either a bit colder/hotter.


Any thoughts on what may have happened here? What should the end result of this be? Cut out all the felt paper, corner holes blocked up, and the fireplace knockout sealed up? Assuming that there is still a lack of airflow after that point – should leaving those corner holes open be an issue?",0,1,HomeImprovement,2014

I have had two inspectors and most recently an engineer come look at the floors/crawl and determine the cause. All three say that it isn’t structural and is most likely related to changes in humidity. The advice I received was to install a vapour barrier and wait for the humidity to stabilize (3-6 months). Once this occurs then the floors should begin to even out. We’re going forward with installing the vapour barrier and resloping our yard as an extra measure; however, even without these measures our crawl space is bone-dry. I asked the engineer whether we should add additional support to the main beam as well, but he said that would be premature and we should wait the 3-6 months to see if the floors even out with the installation of a vapour barrier.

   Because the cabinets are being installed on top of the tile, am I going to run into issues with a slide-in gas range not fitting properly? Could the height become an issue and not match?

nh5779,"Ceiling and wall cracks, structural damage or settling?","We bought our home 3 years ago in a rainy South Seattle neighborhood on a hill that slopes towards Lake Washington. Built in 1962 so some settling is expected. The home also needed a lot of work including a new roof, chimney mortar/veneer replacement and counter flashing.

I have noticed cracks in many parts of the home's walls and ceilings, patched from previous owners. Most cracks are isolated to a single portion of a wall, and not running across multiple walls or continuing from the ceiling to side walls. Biggest cracks are around the fireplace brick stack leading up to the attic. You can also see slight gaps between the where vaulted wood ceiling beams touch the lid.

nh541u,Hail Mary to Clean Shower Diverter Cartridge?,"I just bought a new house. The water pressure in the master shower was terrible in spite of it being a new renovation! New pipes in the walls, so that's weird. The plumber traced to a stretch of galvanized pipe in the basement which was easily replaced. That improved the water pressure in most faucets on that floor, but not the master shower!

The plumber suggested that the shower cartridge was probably full of particulate matter that came up from the galvanized pipe, so we replaced that and.... no improvement! So the plumber has now suggested that the only thing left to replace, basically, is a cartridge (?) that is part of the diverter that the previous owners put in.

So there is the normal shower and a hand-held attachment. Under the shower knob is a button to push to divert the water, but the water pressure isn't really high enough fort he diverter to actually work, though we KNOW (we've tested) that the water pressure *before* the diverter is amazing. That is, when we took off the shower cartridge and turned on the water, it shot horizontally across the shower stall with great force.

So the diverter is probably the issue, and the plumber says there is a cartridge that is part of the diverter that he would need to replace to fix it. The problem is, we can't access the cartridge without cutting through a built-in bookcase on the opposite wall (and another $1400 bill!)

I put the question to my friends about what could be done, and someone suggested soaking the cartridge in vinegar. Problem is, I can't *access* this diverter without cutting through the bookcase (as I said before), so to do this I would basically pour vinegar into the shower at the top and have it run down to where the hand-shower comes out, kind of running vinegar backward through the diverter. I could cap the hand-shower so that the vinegar kind of pools in the wall, as well, giving it time to soak.

It's an interesting idea. I'm not sure it'll work - depends on what's the cause of the problem - if it's lime scale causing the problem, it could help. My question is: will this... damage anything? Am I going to turn a $1400 bill into a total shower redo? Am I going to damage any of my lovely new copper pipes in the wall?",4,0,HomeImprovement,2228

This space is on an exterior wall and is pretty well insulated, but I still had a pipe freeze this past winter (luckily no damage).  I would like to put some minimal level of heat in there to keep the pipes from freezing again.  There is a 120v outlet in the space.  There’s no way to extend the existing heating system into the space.  I’m trying to figure out what safest and best option is.  

For obvious reasons I don’t want to put a space heater in there, and I think it is too small for a small electric baseboard heater.    I have been thinking about two options so far: I) getting a small 120v heating mat like you would use on stairs to melt snow and hanging it in the space, or II) getting 2-3 heat lamps like you would use to keep reptiles warm and mounting them in there.   I would plug either option into a digital temperature controller switch in the space.    I don’t need to keep it 70 degrees, but maybe around 40 degrees.

nh04a4,"HVAC question - putrid, rotten smell when running A/C (central air unit)","I am *hopeful* someone may be able to help because we are out of ideas and are about to call an HVAC professional - but I thought I’d try here first to see if we are missing something or could have a better understanding of what to look for. 

We’ve lived in the property for about 3 years and never had this issue until about month ago. 

When we turn on our central air, there is a *horrid* stench. The best I could compare it to would be rotten pickled eggs - it’s terrible. 

This only seems to occur when the AC is running. Not the heat (which is gas). The smell is only concentrated in the main living area with the most strongest scent coming from near our front door which opens directly into the living room from a deck. We really don’t notice it in other rooms of the home. 

We initially thought maybe the filter needed replaced - which we did. This helped for maybe 2-3 days but the smell is back. 

We unscrewed the vent where the smell is the strongest and stuck our phones inside to try and see if we could notice anything in the vent - we found nothing within what our phones could view. 

The only things I can think of are that maybe the unit needs cleaned? Or maybe something died below our deck that is somehow being pulled into the unit? Is it even possible something is in the ductwork?

ngvmuh,How to make a sump system more reliable?,"I have two pumps in my sump.  Saved me tonight.

Main sump just stopped working.  Battery sump worked, but didn't sound it's alarm.  Or the water climbed to 1/2"" from the lip and t he main one ran.

Something about the change of sound woke me and I found the water 3"" from the lip.

Float said that the battery one should work.  Ran it manually.  Pump works.  At this point I'm not quite sure what happened.

I keep a spare pump on a 70 chunk of black poly pipe.  dropped it into the sump ran the line out the patio door and plugged it in. Pulled the old pump, so that it's float wouldn't interfere.

I'm writing this while listening to it cycle every 3 minutes.  (We had 1.2 inches of rain yesterday, on ground already soggy.

This pump is less than 5 years old.  But sump pumps here lead an active life.  It  has runs year round for the last two years, as has our intermittent creek.  Much of the winter it runs only once a day.  In spring run off season it can run as often as every 80 seconds.  Right now it's running about every 3 minutes.

I'd like a more reliable system, and one that I can run in duplex.  From my research pedastal pumps are the least reliable.  The switch goes. The bearings go.  The floating ball switches are supposed to be good for very long periods.  But running two of them in an 18"" confined space is problematic.  I don't know right now if it is the switch or the pump

Pressure switches designed to work with small differences don't seem to be common. A 1 foot water level difference is about 1/2 psi. And in practice you want it adjust it to a finer level than that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So questions:

Q1:  What do I look for in a reliable sump pump?  Or do I just replace it every 2 years broken or not?

Q2:  How do I keep multiple pumps in a small sump?  (I was thinking of using a small jet pump if I could figure out how to maintain the prime.  The sump some years has actually dried out.)

Q3: Anyone know of a a type of water level switch that doesn't take up as much room, or have the potential to tangle?

Q4:  References for sump design?

Q5: Recommendations for a really LOUD water alarm.  I've tried a couple and they produce a very shrill sound that can't be heard 2 rooms away.

ngv0bo,So...I effed up. How do I tackle this roach problem and correct my mistake?,"I hope this is the right place for my questions. I recently moved into an apartment and noticed a few roaches in 20 minutes on the first night. Notified the landlords and they had pest “control” come out, who apparently comes out every 2 months. I’m 99% sure they’re ineffective and keep them down to a minimal, but I want all roaches GONE. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to break my lease since they’re not violating any landlord laws, and my neighbors will continue to be unhygienic. (I peeped some things.)

So first...my problem:

First day I googled stuff and panic-bought Advion. I applied it directly to crevices throughout my apartment (mostly in kitchen and bathroom) because I have pets. But apparently I’m not supposed to apply it directly in cracks because it needs to be replaced? If that’s the case, do I just scrape it out or is it okay if it just dries in there? 

Second: 

I read about Bengal Roach Killer and want to purchase some to use instead of Advion since it’s also an IGR (destroys their reproductive cycle). Would it be okay to use with Advion already in place?

Third:

The caulk job is legit terrible. It seemed normal to me because I’m used to see this in the hood, but after research this isn’t normal. I wish I knew more about this before deciding to move in, but being a young adult in my first apartment, I didn’t know all the fine details. If I can, I want to do the caulking myself. So considering the fact that I used Advion in the crevices, is it a bad idea to caulk with the Advion in place? Also, should I use Bengal Roach Killer before or after caulking?

ngut91,Wanting to add a landscaped area to tile but concerns about effect on flooding,"https://imgur.com/g2ab4c6

https://imgur.com/3oimkzR

Hello everyone.

I live in a townhouse that doesn’t have any grass. The front and back are tiled but the back is strictly a utility area. I want to covert 1/2 of the front into a landscaped area so my kids can have a place to play and to have something nice to look at. I have included a diagram of what I would like to do but I have some concerns because whenever we get heavy prolonged rain the front and back flood.

As you may see in the photo, the front is more or less enclosed in concrete walls, its also concrete to right of the car. The only inlet and outlet is the front gate. 

When we get heavy rains, the street outside floods and the water level rises above that opening (circled in red). Once it does that, the water inside has no where to go but forward towards our house which is just a wall of slide glass doors. It’s not all disaster though because the the water only accumulates to right side of the support column because the left side is slightly higher. Both sides have bilge pumps installed and in the rare circumstance that the water rises high enough we block the sliding doors with sand bags. Water has not gotten inside the house but its come close a couple of times. The street floods 4-5 times a year.

What I am wondering is that if I do the following ( and as shown in the diagram), will it make my problem worse or will it possibly help:

The green area will be artificial grass that will just be placed on the tile with no adhesion. It will be held in place by concrete planters and bricks place on the edges of the grass. 

The white area will be a small Japanese Garden. The border will be white bricks and concrete planters. I am going to lay the bricks sideways so the holes in the brick can be used as drainage so the bricks will create a border around 7cm tall. On one side of the border, the planters will make up part of the border. They are 30cm tall and 100cm long. 

Inside of the border will be filled with a 6cm layer of gravel or small river rock pebbles to match what we seen in Japanese rock gardens. I will add some large rocks and plants and also a centerpiece Bonsai in the middle of the garden.

So will adding the landscaping help with managing the flow of the water or will it hurt it?",0,0,HomeImprovement,2295

ngoika,Vinyl under flooring?,"I don’t know if this is a thing. For context, I’m a newish homeowner trying to finish a basement that has always had seeping problems. Last year I paid for waterproofing and the installation of a sump pump in a space that never had one.

I’ve been preparing to put flooring down soon, but the spring rains have started and to my dismay (considering the enormous expense), while the issue isn’t as bad, the basement is anything but “waterproofed”. There is no standing water but the concrete flooring is darkening with moisture in the usual trouble spots even though the sump has been working, and I imagine it’ll only get worse as we’re only on day 2 of a 2-week deluge.

My question is: when laying down flooring, can you put a layer of vinyl underneath to keep the water out? My walls have vinyl sheets to direct water down into the gutter system, so I’m picturing something like that: sheets of vinyl between the concrete floor and whatever laminate I put down.

My income is not high, which is why finding water in my basement after so much money spent is making me desperate to find something that’ll stop this so I can just finish the dang space.

Update: I was already bringing the installation company in to look at the moisture leaks before I posted here (and they agree they need to fix a couple of issues!) but I appreciate the advice and will be getting additional subflooring anti-moisture material to double down on no water! They’re pretty confident the moisture is because the installation crew didn’t take out walls and connect the vinyl around them, instead for some reason cutting the vinyl to follow the walls instead..",8,1,HomeImprovement,1639

My questions are the following:

1.) Does $3,600 sound reasonable to run a new underground connection 100 ft?  
2.) Do I need to have the entire thing re-run? Isn't it possible to just have the connection repaired at the broken spot instead?

Hi Everyone,

Our front porch leaks water into the basement when it gets wet. I suspected that there was no seal behind the vinyl siding and between the concrete step and house wood. I tore into one side and confirmed my findings. It's happening on both sides of the porch but wanted to take one side apart first for inspection. The structural wood seems to mostly ok. 

I'll need to repair both sides and possibly replace the decorative wood below the front storm door so that I can get a solid seal around the whole step. 

I want to seal this the best way possible and replace at least 1 double row of siding on both sides of the porch and replace the decorative wood. Basically creating a nice seal around the step against the house. 

I was thinking some kind of caulk then some some sort of metal flashing and then reinstalling the siding. 

I'd love some thoughts if possible and maybe some suggestions on the right caulk to use or other suggestions. We are in Central Ohio so our winters are cold if that helps anything.

ngkidb,Help! Deck joist rot,"[https://imgur.com/a/0B94aUt](https://imgur.com/a/0B94aUt)

  

Help, I don’t know what step to take.

We’ve been in our house 6 years now, don’t know how long the deck has been here but it’s at least 12 years old.  The deck boards have always been in a bad state, some warping and cupping, a lot of severe checking, and even some punkiness in some of the boards. The footings, post, and joists always looked in a great state so I thought when the time comes I would just replace the deck boards a few at a time as needed.

However, I noticed when looking carefully at some of the wider seams where I can see the joist, some of them seemed to have checks going across the top, and seemed punky when pressing with screwdriver. So today I decide to expose one of these to see how bad, and it turns out quite bad:

It seems that over time water has infiltrated through the nail holes (nails are all rusted badly) and deposited inside the joists, and have rotted them from the inside like a cavity. As you can see I can dig out all this rich compost-like rot, and this rot goes about 2-3 inches into the 2x8 joist. The outer ½ inch on either side of the rot is surprisingly intact. It’s like an ice cream sandwich.

I had no idea the rot would be this bad. I would say only 1 out of 20 ‘seams’ would have this type of punkiness, the others seem OK when poking from the top with screwdriver, but who knows what is under the surface.

A few questions.

1) Can this be DIY salvaged? I had originally planned to dig out the punk and fill with wood epoxy but I don’t know if that is a valid option, seeing how deep the rot goes. I’m slightly below average handy.

2) Assuming that the posts and footings are OK, can this be subjected to ‘major repair’ by professionals, where they replace the rotten joists and boards? Or would this be a complete ‘tear down and build new’ job?

3) In either case, any rough thoughts on how much I can expect to have to pay? The deck is quite large, roughly about 25 feet by 20 feet, with some irregular shapes.

4) How could this have been prevented? Deck joist tape? Caulk around nail holes?

I should note that the deck is only 3 feet off the ground so I am not majorly concerned about it falling out from under our feet and us getting injured. You would NOT guess that this deck has problems, it is VERY solid to walk around on.",3,1,HomeImprovement,2356

ngkgz1,Air test turned up one single asbestos fiber,"I recently had work done on my house. The contractor got dust everywhere. The work was done in the basement. We knew it was unlikely that what he worked on contained asbestos but did an air quality test anyway. A professional company came and did air pumps for a few hours and the results in the basement showed no asbestos in the air, nothing   in two other areas but did find one single fiber in the last area tested on the second floor. One fiber is well below the limit to do anything about but I can't help but wonder if there's asbestos lurking somewhere or if it blew in from somewhere or was carried in somehow. Under the floorboards near the room where this testing location was has some pipes. The floor boards are 100 years old and have lots of openings which is how I know what they look like. From what I can tell there is no insulation on them but I'm not an expert. I wonder if it did it could have made it's way through a floor board crack and if so should I be worried about more exposure. We will actually be covering those floors with new hardwood in a few weeks. My other thought was it blew in from the condemned house about  30 feet away which has no internal walls and all the windows open (if there an actual pane still) and had a ton of insane diy work.

ngiydq,Electrical panel replacement quote weirdness... or not?,"So, I bought a house very recently, and there are some big things on the to do list as the house is pretty outdated. Number 1 on the list is the fact that the house still has the original Stablok Federal Pacific electric panel. 
This panel services the original half of the house, and is located in the pantry in the kitchen (this part is important). I called a local electrical contractor here and they ballpark estimated the cost of replacement of around $1000-$1500. I think this is reasonable. 
They sent someone out to work on replacing it and immediately ran into an issue. Turns out that the dimensions of the new replacement panels are much larger than the older panel, and the stud distances in the pantry are not wide enough to fit the new one. Because of this, they want to install the new panel on another wall that is ~10 inches away. This is fine, but they redacted their estimate and instead are now estimating $2500. Does this sound reasonable? The panel is nearly in the same spot, just on an adjacent wall. I know that they will have to cut a new hole in the wall and rerun some lines and probably extend others, but is it possible that they couldn't just get a smaller electrical panel as a more 'direct replacement'? So we don't have to move it in the first place? We asked them if that's possible and they said that they don't sell smaller panels like that anymore as the industry standard has changed. I'm just hoping to get confirmation that this is all reasonable sounding. 

Thank you.

Tldr; Old panel dangerous. New panel much larger than old, so it needs to be moved so they don't do stud work. New place is still super close to old spot, but estimate jumped up by $1000. Reasonable?

ngho7y,Window installer giving me the run around.,"Hey Ya'll I'm not a frequent reddit-er so go easy on me.

I have hired a company to replace all the windows in my home. They came in at a great price, are local and family owned and I thought awesome! Until, things started to get frustrating.

Firstly the install date they booked us on was pretty far out (8 weeks) but I understood that everyone and their mothers are doing home projects right now so I thought, it is what it is. However, he told me that they FREQUENTLY are able to get people in weeks before their actual install date. Great I thought. Worst case scenario, windows late spring. We singed the contract and paid 60% upfront.

They cancelled the final measurement appt. weeks later (calling the night before). I let them know that I had taken the day off work for them to come, an it was an inconvenience. They apologized and said that they would work around my schedule next time. OK thanks.

Then I didn't hear from them, for weeks....I emailed, I called, nothing...I finally after several ""hey hows it going"" type emails I was more aggressive and told them I am very concerned with the lack of communication. I got a rude call back telling me that they are very busy, and lost and installer and all that...fine. An email takes 30 seconds to write, that was my frustration.

At this point, I'm losing faith. Ok, here comes the install date. I email them to confirm, no response. I email a second time. I get a call, the story is that they are missing some part thats been on backorder for 6 weeks, so they weren't going to do my windows on the install date. He said the supplier was expecting the shipment of I don't know what the following week, and he would let me know.

A week goes by, I hear nothing. Another week goes by, nothing. I email the owner. Same story ""I actually just got off the phone with the supplier, and they are expecting the shipment next week"" at least he admits... ""but I don't know because they have said this for weeks"".

I asked if there was a plan B, since this supplier was first behind 6 weeks, then 8, now 10, and possibly beyond. What if this goes on forever? He simply said it won't, and something about he supplier merging with some other supplier and things are only going to get better.......

Am I wrong to be annoyed af? At a certain point doesn't the window manufacturer seek a new supplier to satisfy his waiting clients? And what are my legal protections should I just keep getting the run around. I really want them to do my windows because the price was really what we could afford, but at a certain point if I decide cancel can I get my money back since the contract clearly says the installation date and we are well passed that?

My husband is in construction and he has told me he has trouble getting parts too right now so I get it, I do. But I also run a business and if I can't get what I need from a supplier I figure out a way, I don't have the luxury of telling people ""maybe next week""...""maybe next week""...Indefinitely.

nghlzi,Poorly Vented Attic Kneewall. Solar attic fan?,"I have a 115 year old home. Multiple iterations of Frankenstein renovations.

The attic has been converted. There is a 6 ft knee wall with a sizable insulated area 6ft tall (sloping down to the soffit edge), about 8 ft  wide to edge of soffit, and about 40 ft long. 

The former owners/sadists effectively sealed the gap between knee wall and the gable vent at the peak of the roof. Roof is SW facing black asphalt shingles. I live in UT. Summers are deadly. AC can’t keep up.

1. Soffit is totally clogged with blown in cellulose.

I think it might just be easier to take the soffit off, clear it out, and re-install? It’s deep, buried in the crotch of the sloped roof and 40 ft of it.

nggdol,Notify neighbor of new fence?,"Hello! 

We are building a new privacy fence on three sides of our property- there is no existing fence on these sides. 

We live in a tight urban neighborhood which means that our new fence will butt up to our neighbors deck (there is approx 1’ between our new fence and their deck) 

Our fence is within city code, designed by a contractor ( who will also install) and will block them entirely when complete. 

We can find no information about whether we are obligated to inform these neighbors. 
My partner thinks its good form to tell them and i agree but don’t think it’s necessary - for two reasons:

1.  They rent and are not the owners of the property (we do not know or have contact info for the owner)

2.  We put up a temporary shelter/pop up tent for a little while in the yard and the neighbor complained that it was “blocking the light from her plants” 
Which it was, and which the new fence will do permanently. So i worry that she’ll cause us strife. 

Honestly- i can’t wait to be fenced in away from these folks- due to my judgmental  feelings toward their hoard/animal care/endless barking in my face etc. 

So obviously i’m biased. 

Reddit- do we have an obligation to inform the tenants next door about our impending privacy fence?


EDIT: wow- this is touching a lot of folks right in the sweet spot- 

REGARDING THE FOLLOWING:

1. There is no HOA, permitting or city requirements for this type of fence, its height, or our property type (residential) we are entirely within our rights to build it with out needing approval from the city or county. 

2. Regarding the property line- we did not have it surveyed- we were actually unable to find someone to do such a “small scale” job in our rapidly gentrifying area. However- it is not a requirement- it was more of a “lets be really sure” type scenario. We used the records with the city to verify our basic perimeter and are using it. 
We felt comfortable doing this as the neighbors deck is also directly on the line so it’s anyones guess who is on each others property. In fact- we are opting to leave this 1’ foot of space so that they have some room to repair said deck if needed (its needed) we felt that if the owner of the rental had concern- they could pay for the survey which could likely result in their deck being in the wrong. Also- we have a small shed on this same line and this has not been brought up to us as a line violation. 

3. RENTERS ARE THE SAME VALUE AS ALL HUMANS 

i did not mean to diminish renters- more so- they are likely to move out (again- expensive city) and 
over correcting to their preference (flower light and whatnot) is a habit we are trying to avoid. People pleasers here. 

4. And finally- we are still unsure of our next steps but want to thank everyone for their input- there are good bits here that we didn’t think about as we are blinded by the ever present shrill barking of one chihuahua and the owner screaming at it to shut up.",217,203,HomeImprovement,2952

I just did my first ever electrical DIY by replacing one of the old light switches in our new house. It was a 3-way switch. Of course I got the ground in there correctly, common was black, travelers red and white. Turned the fuse back on and everything works from both switches. I even tightened the loop for most of the wires with needle-nose pliers to make sure it was tight around the screw.

However, we're leaving for about a week in a few hours. Is there any way what I just did could like...start a fire and burn the house down? lol. Just a bit nervous as we don't have any sort of remote smoke detector stuff and I don't really know what would happen if I somehow did it wrong.

ngei58,Help! Sewage smell in house!,"Over the past couple of weeks, I will occasionally get whiffs of a smell of sewage in the house that we own. I only smell it in 3 spots in my house: In the hallway linen closet, near the toilet in the bathroom, and near the kitchen sink/dishwasher (but only when the dishwasher is running). The smell is ONLY coming from these three spots. Neither our laundry room, bathtub/shower, or bathroom sink drains give off the odor. 

The sewage smell is the strongest at the base of my linen closet pictured here: https://imgur.com/a/ZKWCVyZ

The closet gives off at the very least a slight smell almost constantly and the strength of the smell fluctuates. Some days the stench is stronger than it is on other days. 

We keep the house fairly clean. The kitchen is cleaned daily. The bathroom gets cleaned twice a week. Everything else is cleaned once a week. Also, I clean the garbage disposal and the dishwasher/filter weekly.

The house is pretty small. Here is a video clip of a walkthrough showing the three problem spots and the proximity to each other: https://imgur.com/a/SbNmXqt

11’ out from house, 20’ wide, with stairs going down approximately 6’. Rectangular deck to minimize wasted wood.

When I first got bids, materials were estimated between $5,000-$8,000. Trex decking, 20’ engineered beam. Hogwire railing. 

Total cost was about $12k-$15k. 50/50 labor and materials.

Now my contractors are saying materials have doubled since then, so we’re looking at roughly $10,000 for materials. $8,000 in labor. One contractor said to expect a final bill about $20k.

Some ways Ive already planned to make this easier to swallow:

- excavate and pave an under deck shed. A 10’ x 20’ shed with 7’ ceilings would be like a small 1-car garage.

- shorter wood risers/taller pylons

- re-use existing deck trex on stairs, railing tops.

- re-use as much of the good wood as possible from the exisiting 6x9 deck.

- build the deck small today with the ability to easily extend it if/when materials decrease in price.

They took the grate off the shower drain and said that they didn’t even see a waterproof barrier going into the drain and that it’s def going to leak. Pointed out areas where the previous renovator made really dumb decisions. Super negative attitude. Basically painted a doomsday picture of the home I just bought.

Situation: ceiling is fairly even, but not level. It is raked as it used to be an open porch. The rake is NOT severe enough to employ methods for installing crown on a cathedral ceiling. We have a piece that rises 3/4” over its 3’ length. 

Our plan is to install that piece first, then cope the adjoining pieces (each adjoining piece is a ~90 degree corner). The crown is paint grade, so can employ paintable caulk etc. 

Is this a good plan, or will the mismatch in visible height be obvious where the corners meet?

Or is it crappy because this non-level piece of crown will be only about 4” above a window casing that IS level (thus highlighting that the crown is raked). Should we shave off the top of the crown at one end to accommodate for part of the rise? 

It’s not large crown: about 2-1/4”

ngdc0c,Lead Paint in Windows - No AC & Can't Replace,"We live in a 1920s home that is basically all original, and unsurprisingly, found lead paint in the window trim/windows & door trims (with the at home test kit). We have a toddler and are planning on another child soon. The paint is old and under several layers of newer/non lead paint but there are definitely places where the paint is chipping.

We're in the midst of a major renovation (mostly DIY).  Renovated area is being blocked off with plastic and we are careful about not letting the toddler play near it so less worried about what the renovation itself will trigger - we'll clean thoroughly before we move back in. We also wear P100 masks when we're in there. We've ripped out all of the trim and are planning to replace the doors. Unfortunately, we can't afford to replace the windows (multiple quotes we've gotten are in the $75Kish range, we live in a VHCOL area).

That might be fine (I hear lead is fine if you leave it be) except that we also don't have air conditioning, and we live in a part of the country where it does get quite hot in the summer. It's not really feasible to never open the windows. Our toddler has had his lead levels checked and so far they're fine.

While we plan to replace the windows eventually, we won't be able to in the near term. As a stopgap solution, we were planning on replacing the existing window trim (obviously) and painting over the sills/sashes/rails as much as we can. We know that's not a perfect plan given that windows opening and closing will create friction and potentially stir up dust.

I recently had to deal with a failing wax ring under a toilet on hardwood floor, and was able to notice the problem quickly because the floorboards started warping, but now I'm scarred and am worried about the non-wood floor toilets in my house....how do I know they're not leaking too?

I'm worried though that perhaps the seal is broken. There's no standing water or anything on the tile, but one area looks maybe wet. When I feel it though or try to put TP there to see if it can be soaked up, it feels greasy, not wet, and is maybe slightly yellow--there is radiant heat, so I thought maybe that's melted wax, but the heating stops short of the toilet.  Should I just pull this toilet up too and replace the seal as precaution? Or is there something I can do short of that to confirm the problem (or lack thereof)?

A bit of context first, I live in Germany, and my house has a concrete structure. We ripped out most of everything that was in it, and we are building back up now. We will have in-floor heating installed through a method that digs a trench into the concrete floor, where the piping is laid and then covered.

I'll be putting a new layer of screet in my bathroom next week to replace what was taken out during the renovations, and to provide the surface that the in-floor heating trench will be dug into.

The screed I'm using is in 30kg bags, and works out to about 15L final product each, meaning I would need 13.2 bags, 14 or even 15 for good measure. 1st question, do those numbers seem right?

My intended method is to build a plywood wall, to keep the screed away from where the bathtub will be placed. Once that is boxed off, I'll take my final height from the hallway floor, measure up 1m, use a laser level to transfer that height to the bathroom, and mark the height + 1m around the room, to measure down from to get my final surface height.

I'll use a straight 2x4 to level out the screed in the middle once I have the right height around the edges, and can check my height with a marked stick and the laser level. I'll work the screed in batches, as I only have about 40 min to work with it once it's wet.
2nd question, does that sound like a workable approach? I'm doing it on my own, and have about a 5 hour window in the day to do it all. It needs to be poured then, so it is set enough for when the company comes to dig the trench for the in-floor heating.

ngadwj,Adding additional backyard flood light on existing switch,"Hello home improvement!

I am a brand new homeowner in central Ohio who is a jack of no trades and also a master of no trades but trying to DIY as much as possible.

My backyard is pretty large and we have a small dog and want to be able to light up the backyard with flood lights when she goes out to play at night. The house currently has a flood light mounted at a location that is honestly… pretty dumb. I’d like to add a second flood light to cover the yard better.

The switch is on the exterior wall of an interior hallway and the current light is on the exterior of the garage and the proposed location is on the exterior of the living room. The siding is vinyl.

How would you all suggest I get an electrical line from the existing light to the proposed light location, how do I mount a box to the wall to then mount the new light to it, and what materials would I use?

nga7gr,Pennsylvania Fencing Requirements Question,"My husband and I are just brainstorming right now, so I'm hoping some of you will have some insight here. We just bought a new house and are getting some quotes to install fencing (covering about .3 acres). We need to be able to let our dog outside without worrying about him going into the street. Within the next two years, we plan to put in an in-ground pool. We got a few quotes for that already so we can budget accordingly.

I checked with the township, county, and state guidelines online, and a fence (48 inches in height) for the pool is definitely required: 

""The fence should be at least 4 feet high, and have self-closing and self-latching gates that open outward, with latches that are out of the reach of children.""

Does this mean immediately around the pool, or does my whole yard just have to have a fence of at least 48""? If we put up a 48"" fence for the whole backyard, will this satisfy the requirement?

My township doesn't have any phone numbers or contact information listed or I'd just contact them (which at some point I'll probably have to do but for now just wondering what your experiences have been).",7,1,HomeImprovement,1130

I run boiling water down my floor drains every day. I’ve tried the vinegar and baking soda trick. None of it has seemed to work. I’m constantly spraying with Lysol, putting in deodorizers, baking soda, activated charcoal, but nothing seems to work.

The smell doesn’t come strongly from any of my floor drains. Oddly enough, I can’t smell it when I crouch down to the floor but can smell it when I stand up.

But I'm looking for ways to potentially increase our comfort through other means. To help visualize, we have a 2 bedroom house with a basement. There are three floors: the basement, the main level and the bedrooms above that. The thermostat is on the main level and currently set to 23C. All AC vents and returns in the house are open.

Right now it's about 27C outside and we have our AC running to make the main level comfortable. Our basement (where I have my desk for WFH) is frigid cold, the main level is a good temperature, but the bedrooms are still way too hot, even during night time.

So first the basement: will there be any issue shutting off all of the AC vents in the basement and leaving the return that's down there open? In my head this would stop the AC from cooling the basement and leave more cool air for the main level and bedrooms.

And next the master bedroom: it is built above our open porch and I suspect there is very little insulation between the floor and the outside world, because in the winter the bedroom is freezing cold and in the summer it's boiling hot. What can we do to improve the comfort in this room if it's just a case of really poor floor insulation?

I will be speaking with my installer and want to solidify two things first:

1) The wave could/should have been accounted for in the install process. If it wasn’t possible to do so, we should have had a discussion and remediated prior to installation. Am I crazy here?

How important is it to insulate around the pipe?,"I moved into a new home 3 months ago and it turns out a frost-proof spigot had frozen and was lying in wait for me to turn it on this spring.  The previous owner failed to winterize it properly and left a shutoff valve installed and closed, so the water couldn't drain out. The pipe burst and caused thousands in damage. At least now I know how to prevent that.

Anyway, a plumber came and replaced the frost-proof spigot with a new one. But it seems the process of pulling the old one out took some of the previous spray foam along with it. So now there's a bit of a gap between the new one and the hole through the exterior of the house. To be clear, I can't see daylight coming through or feel a noticeable draft, but the insulation just isn't as snugged up against it. 

The valve of the new spigot is within the envelope of the home (so it should stay warm), but it's also inside a wall, so perhaps it won't be exposed to as much direct heating.

I live alone and my water usage isn't much. 2) I can replace a tank water by myself with some help from a friend to move the tanks. 3) I'd love to get rid to the ugly tank and have a little more space in the laundry room. 4) If I go with a tankless heater, I will need a professional to install it adding to the cost overall. 

The tank heater that I'm looking at has a 6 year warranty and is less than $500. The tankless heater is about $600, plus venting, updating gas line, and professional install. I'm estimating all in about $1000. Also I can have a tank hot water heater this weekend, but tankless is probably going to take a week or more to get ordered and installed.

Can anyone help me as I make this big decision?

EDIT: Please just give me the benefit of the doubt that I've got the pricing right on the tankless. I have done a lot of research. I'm not buy a big model and I live in a warm part of the country.

UPDATE: I just purchased an EZ Tankless Ultra HE gas tankless for $619. I'm confident I can install it myself and tap into the current vent (only vents current tank heater). Outside of new supply lines which I would have to replace anyways, I think I'll be well under my $1000 estimate.",364,437,HomeImprovement,1536

ng5gzl,Brick Paver Walkway Renovation,"Hey All - we have an existing brick walkway (https://imgur.com/gallery/qDIByKX) to the front of our house that is in need of some repair.  We we considering having a contractor rip it all out and start from scratch, but we actually like the Brick look and think that we can spend a couple hundred dollars including tools, and do it ourselves.

That being said there are 3 main parts of this project:  the walkway itself, the first step, and the landing.

Walkway - currently it is just brick on sand on concrete.  The plan was to remove the brick and bring in some fresh sand to level out and compact it.  I did not think I needed any additional base with the concrete under it.  The walkway is not level from left to right, so the plan is to try and correct that with sand, is that possible or will I need to add crushed stone to the top of the concrete to make it level, then an inch of sand on top of that?  Everything I have read online is basically starting from scratch which seems like a waste here, so I would like to use the concrete that is there if possible, but wanted to get some feedback on how I would go about that.

Once complete, I was going to add the plastic trim to the outside to hold it in place, and just use regular sand between the bricks.  Not sure why you would use the poly sand vs regular sand.

First Step - this was just bricks on their side set in mortar before.  This is not level, and not high enough so I was going to remove this, take it apart, add another layer of brick below it, and reset in mortar before continuing on the upper walkway.

Landing - this is generally in good shape, but some of the mortar joints are looking rough so I was just going to grind out the joints where possible, and tuck point it.  For the spots on the side that are falling off I would just try to use the mortar to reattach.

Any thoughts are welcomed as always!",2,6,HomeImprovement,1883

I've recently installed some shelly dimmers (they are relays that I put behind the switches, that always have power so I can control lights via API, and still retain the function of the light switches). They work fantastically ... but right now I can only dim via API, and toggle on/off from the switch.

But my current light switches aren't ideal for this, as they have on-off mode. I can still use it to turn on/off the lights, but not dim them.

I wonder if there are light switches that ""pop back"" to a neutral (stateless) mode, and can be pushed up or down. That way I can program it in the relay to turn on/off on a quick click, and dim up/down when I hold it down.

The switch would have two ""exits"", one for up and down (the relay has an SW1 and SW2 input that I can program however I want).

I am actually looking for the name in Spanish since I'm from Spain, but if I can find the English name, I can go to the supply store and show them.

One of issues is, we live in Central Texas and the soil is clay-heavy (Blackland Prairie) so I’m skeptical of how much a foundation-raising would fix the issue.

Overall, I want what’s best for the house, and what will keep the house in good order for as long as possible. I think some of my foundation issues are due to poor drainage (house is a little lower than yard, rain goes towards the house) and plumbing issues (cast iron, yay) which I also plan on fixing (as money allows) but it seems like if I’m gonna raise my foundation, it should be the first thing I do in this series of steps.

So one day I realized my fan was busted out and then I found out it wasn't even venting outside! Just back into the attic. So I had a roofing company come out and out an exhaust fan. Want us to install the new fan they asked? 

No thank you I said. Figured it would be easy. Even though I'm not an electrician, I figured I could wire the box the same way.

Old and new fan look like this https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B086XMDSR1#Ask
Any whoooo, to get the fan out was a pain, it was screwed every which way into the joists and had two, 2x4s double rigged to hold the box over the attic. I didn't mind but they would have made it way easier had they ran the 15 1/2 side by the 16 in gap but oh well. They had to do it maybe because its lath and plaster. I get it. 


Anyway. I took some pics of the old fan which is the same exact fan as the new one but old....new fan just had a crimp wire connect and pig tail off it with another small blue wire. Maybe 18awg. 

I have some questions. Yes I turned off the breaker. Made sure to label all of them. I'm in Chicago which I believe has different code than some other places. 

My conduit coming in to the box has 4 wires. 2 black. One red. One white. The bathroom switch has 3 switches. One for the light. The fan. The heater.

Upstairs in my Attic I have a heat pump and two ductless systems in my house. One on each floor. Not sure if this affects my situation. They run on 240v I believe. 

I connected the new box the same way as the old box. I flipped the breaker back on and ran the heater for 5 minutes. And the fan. Didn't connect the lightbulb as I figured that was fine as well. 

 Before I screw everything down. I want to make sure everything is wired correctly? I can hire an electrician but if I can learn for free I think that's a valuable lesson.

Questions I have, are there 3 live wires coming in? The two black and one red? One white is neutral? Does that mean no ground?

Why did the new fan have a blue wire with a double ended connect with a pigtail?

Is the neutral always straight wire while the others are stranded for identification?

Wouldn't the metal casing inside the fan/motor act as a ground? Is a gfi needed? Fan is about 2 feet from shower and 4 feet from shower head. Have a separate gfi panel next to sink.

The previous owners had provided proof that they had someone come out and completely redo the electrical, but at this point, we're pretty sure either they didn't or they picked an awful electrician. (We cannot turn on the fan in our baby's room because it shorted and almost caused a fire, is one example). 

Plumbing has a question mark next to it because we have not determined if it is the plumbing or just the well water pump not working efficiently. It's the water pressure/the amount coming out of some of the faucets, and the washing machine takes forever because of this, as well. Still, it'll likely be costly whether it is the plumbing or just the pump itself. Just something to note.

Everything else is pretty straight forward. We had to take out the bedroom doors because they were broken/uneven/not closing.

The bathrooms need updating. Redoing the tiled showers (they were poorly done, sealants are coming off and grout isn't holding; the floors in the kitchen have the same issue, and some of the floor tiles have popped out of place).

Which leads into why we need to replace the floors. Initially we just wanted to change them for cosmetic reasons, but now we realize we would've needed to anyways. Pretty much everything you can think of was done poorly in the house, which includes the flooring. 

And lastly, we will be repainting.

So, any advice on what order we should do these projects? Or recommendations on what to look out for/be prepared for?

Honestly, anything you think would be helpful given the information above.

(Personally, I'm tempted to just save up to tear the place down and start from scratch cause the electrical is going to equal the cost of just tearing down the house. Estimates for both electrical and demolition are at around 11k).

I live on the topmost floor of an old apartment building. The heat + humidity is punishing in the summer (or even now) and I need to pay extra to use AC. So, to help a bit, I was thinking of making a sort of ceramic tile ""carpet"" that I could get out and lay in the summer to block some of the heat rising through my floors (currently either ""floating"" slats or, my bet is lino slats made to look like wood).

My plan is to grab a box of light, ceramic floor tiles, and drill holes close to the corner of each tile. When they needed to be ""installed"" I would link them together to cover as much or as little area as I needed, creating a sort of floor chainmail. My issue is with the ""links"" themselves, I don't really know what I could use that would allow the tiles to be stable, and yet not have too much of a high profile that walking is painful. The links would also need to be removed come fall so that the tiles could be separated and put away.

nfsm95,Garage conversion: venting under raised subfloor?,"Hi all!

Would love some opinions here. I have an old attached garage, with cinder block walls that I am converting to living space. The garage is sunken, and has a stepup concrete walkway and then the door into the house. The garage is roughly 10"" below the houses finished floors. I'll be building the subfloor up to match.

The issue, which I can't find a direct answer to, or a concensus from contractor friends, is do I need to vent the area below the subfloor?

Once I block up the garage opening, I will be re-grading that outside area so the sealed crawlspace will be technically below grade. Waterproofing aside, we're talking a ~10"" x 400sqft area that's trapped air. 

The other issue is I live in wetlands, so the rainy season can be rough. Meaning I can't just vent the area near grade, I would need to add some vent pipes within the walls and either vent into the soffits or attics. Possibly with an active system instead of a passive one.

Code in my area is mum on this as well. Any thoughts are very much appreciated. Keep in mind I live in the SE US, so think hot, wet and humid. Thanks!",2,1,HomeImprovement,1105

What it looks like is a normal paper-coated sheet of drywall with a very very thin outer drywall set on top somehow as an outer layer. Either that, or it's a multilayered drywall sheet of some sort resembling what was just described.

The issue is that the metal corner bead (which rusted out over the decades because it's next to a bunch of water appliances) is set into this outer layer rather than being laid on top, if that makes sense. That is, it looks like the thin outer layer was cut away to fit the corner bead exactly, or a large sheet of it was cut to fit in between the two (horizontal and vertical) metal corner beads.

nfpt2r,"Best way to install fence posts at a community garden I volunteer at where concrete is not allowed, and the water table is about 10 inches down and constantly fills the holes with water?","Hello!

I have been volunteering at some local community gardens. Its a lot of fun and there are tons of Gardners who are older and unable to do a lot of the physical work so I have been helping out.

The main thing I have been helping them with is replacing the fences between gardens. The fences are very important to keep out animals and keep people from stealing from the gardens which is a huge issue. As a rule, concrete is not allowed at all as it would hurt the plants, and the older residents would never be able to remove it later on.

I was taught the ""proper"" way they recommend installing fences, but it is really frustrating and still leads to wobbly supports, so I wanted to ask if there is a better way. Currently we will use clam shell post hole diggers to dig down anywhere from 24-36 inches down into the soil. After digging down around 10 inches the bottom of the hole starts to fill with water and by the time you get to 28 inches or more the hole is full of water up to about the 10 inches down point, so up to 20 inches of water. Then, we will take a 8 foot 4x4 and put it in the hole, making sure the pole is straight with a level. Then we will start to fill the hole with sand, but because the holes are so full of water the sand raises the water level and sinks to the bottom, bringing the water level all the way up to the top of the hole. We will try and put about 6-10 inches of sand and tamp it down with a tamping tool, but mostly the pole just sinks into the mug mixture at the bottom. Then I will try and add the soil back that we took out and tamp it down, but again it will turn into a mud and the tool just sinks in, barely compacting it. I try and push more and more soil in till the mug gets pretty thick, but that is the best I can do and we usually leave it there.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/8LfzYvs) is what finished fence posts look like with this method.

Is there a better way to do this? Should I try and get a hand water pump to get the water out? When I try and scoop it out it very quickly refills, but maybe I can try and quickly fill it after pumping? Also, should we use something other than Sand like gravel? Also, what kind of wood should we use? Is there a wood that would last longer in the ground with how wet this soil is so they don't have to be replaced so often?

nfpstr,Crooked/Uneven Shower Tiles- Advice on Fixes?,"I am completely redoing our basement and hallway bathrooms, and found some issues with the tiling of the shower walls after my contractor finished them: [https://imgur.com/a/1e69Evz](https://imgur.com/a/1e69Evz)

**Basement**

* Warping & Crookedness: There seems to be warping in the corner where the two sides of the wall meet. It gets more noticeable close to the ceiling and near the floor.
* Unevenness: Some tiles seem to be ""jutting out"" somewhat. 

**Hallway**

* Warping: Overall, I still get the impression that the walls are ""pressing in"", and that they are ballooning somewhat towards the center.
* Asymmetry: The lines don't look parallel to each other, particular on the corners

**My Ask**

I'm still new to the entire home renovation process, and wanted some advice from savvy Redditors:

1. Based on these images, have I described the issues correctly or are there other things I should be pointing out? 
2. What can the contractor realistically do at this point to fix this? I'm not looking for him to bend the laws of physics, but I want to ensure that we are looking for a proactive solution and can avoid excuses (e.g. the tile was crooked, the wall was uneven to begin with, etc).",12,2,HomeImprovement,1202
nfpqda,Well water pressure at 0,"Over the past month I've noticed that sometimes the water would start off slow for a couple seconds, then quickly catch up and jump to full normal pressure.

Today after I filled up the bathtub for my kids I ran some water in the kitchen and the water pressure was slow and did not speed up. I decided to check the pressure on the well and it was at 15... over the course of about 2 minutes the pressure dropped to 0 and the water went to a trickle. 

A neighbor across the road said his well was running dry and that's my concern. But I would assume it wouldn't go from full pressure filling the bathtub, to no pressure at all, in less than 15 minutes, if it was the well running dry.

nfpawi,Adding a deck ledger where houses rim joist had previously been used to anchor deck joists (flashing/membrane considerations).,"Not sure how much sense the title makes, I’ll try to explain the situation I’ve encountered.
What was supposed to be a simple resurfacing of my deck has predictably evolved into a complete replacement with the discovery of rot at every step of the project. 
The original deck it turns out didn’t have a ledger board- the deck joists were attached to the rim joist of the house using hangers, with siding applied between the joists and a proper drip edge at the bottom transitioning to the siding beneath the deck, there was also a drip edge properly applied above the deck. The house was built in ‘74, not sure if this was accepted practice at the time but I can’t seem to find any reference to this practice in my googling. 

Despite the rot plaguing the rest of the deck, the houses rim joist is luckily in perfect shape. Nonetheless, I would like to build the new deck with a ledger board and the structure of the house safely isolated from anything going on with the deck.

My question is what to do with exposed rim joist before mounting the ledger board. My current plan is to cover the exposed wood of the rim joist with adhesive flashing I have on hand, then run 14”aluminum flashing beneath the siding above the exposed area down to the existing drip edge (overlapping of course), with the ledger board being installed against the aluminum.
Is the adhesive flashing redundant given that aluminum flashing will cover the whole area? Any reason not to use the roll I have on hand? There is a door above the ledger I intend to flash properly, but it’s still a potential source of moisture so I thought I’d just tape up the bare wood for good measure. 

I’ve only been able to source rolls of 14” aluminum flashing locally- any compelling reason to track down the vinyl equivalent?

Now need some drywall company to hang drywall, finish it (mud, primer and paint) and then install baseboard. I just need to know if I am being taken advantage or is my idea of what it would cost is completely off.

Details from the most recent quote are further down.

**My home**

Our basement is not big, to give a good idea of the size of the basement, it is rancher that is around 1500 sq ft total, half of that is the basement, and 2/3 of that basement is being drywalled... As indicated in the details below there is no need to drywall the ceiling, so just walls. We have a drop ceiling and are keeping it. 99.9% of the framing is intact. Just a few planks need to be reinstalled. I live about 1hr north of DC.

**Quote background**

Originally the quote was for 15k, which was about 2x what I thought it would be (wrong or right, someone call tell me that) however got the quote down to 10k - but that is **without materials**... Without materials? Is that normal? Nonetheless, I could have sworn, and when I have a call with the salesman I will bring this up, he said he is removing material from the cost (when I balked at the 15k price). In our conversation today he is claiming he never said that, he is just shrinking his profit margin. Not how I remember it at all. So I asked him to provide me an estimate on the cost of materials, which will then probably get it back up close to 15k again. Is 15k a decent price? Is 10k? I was thinking around 7k? Is that unreasonable?

Edit: Note: I had quotes for the entire basement remodel, including the bathroom (these companies were going to do it all, but I decided to go a la carte) for 18k, 25k and 72k (that was ridiculous and I assume they didn't want the job). I based my expectations on those quotes. I already had electric done, just needs to be finished once walls get hung and finished. Carpet will be done later after walls are hung and before baseboard.

**Installation of Drywall to walls (no ceiling)**

nfmryd,Question on House Foundation," 

We are buying a house that seems to have a very strange foundation, and wondered if anyone could tell us what type it is. It was built in 1962. It has a basement with concrete block walls. One room is finished, and the interior walls are set in about 2 feet in from the exterior walls. The way we know this is that the windows are in the exterior walls, of course, but then they are kind of boxed in for about 2 feet to get to the interior walls, much like a skylight. I've never seen this before.

Then in the unfinished basement room, at first it appears that the interior walls are just normal block walls, but then when you look at the window, you can see that the window is set back about 2 feet from the interior wall. This would be the same as in the finished room described above, except that you can actually see the block instead of it being boxed in to hide the block. So strangely, it appears that there are interior block walls that are set in about 2 feet from the exterior block walls, unless I'm missing something.

Then from outside the house, (on the high side of the hill, so the ground is close to the house level), there is a small door for access to something. Normally I wouldn't expect to see a crawl space since it has a basement, but you open the access door and see a space that looks like a crawl space, and you see some type of block there that is about 2 feet wide, consistent with what we see inside the house. I can't see too much inside this crawl space, but it looks kind of like 2 ft pillars? I'm really not sure because I can't see very far inside. The space here is maybe 2 feet tall, and I can't tell how far this space goes under the house, but it can't be very far because the basement walls must start not far from this opening.

Did they ever build houses in the early 60s with double basement walls? It's the strangest thing I've ever seen. Hoping someone can shed some light on this. Thanks so much.",5,1,HomeImprovement,1946

Inexperienced homeowner here. We bought a really nicely finished apartment last September, but many things seem to fall apart after the 'staging' the sellers had done (the last renovation was also done around 15 years ago so some things can also be expected to have to be replaced).

Disappointment aside, we are really struggling to find specialists to repair things.

We are based in Amsterdam and finding contractors that are available or even responding to requests seems to be difficult. 

We finally found someone able to repair our bathroom tile floor (grout had washed away and was causing water damage).
The work that he had done is fine but not perfect. There are smudges and the tiles around the drain already seem chipped. 
It also seems like some of the glue / grouting has been washed down the shower drain, which I believe could cause blockages on the longer run (but am not sure), for now it also really doesn't look nice.
In addition, our lacquered wooden floor around the bathroom has many new scratches on it.
When I asked about his insurance re the floor scratches he offered to come back and repair the wooden floor.

Is it a good idea to accept? Considering he is specialised in tiles, could it be possible that he will cause even more damage to our wooden floor?

And should I ask to replace the tiles that have already chipped?

In addition, he is constantly extremely late to agreed appointments and starting times.

I am not sure what to think and would be grateful for some wise words or experience shared.

nfltwl,Office closet modifications - ideas?,"&#x200B;

 Hi all,

I have a closet in my office with 4 shelves that are 18"" x 77"" (roughy). The shelves are supported by studs (1""x0.5"") that are hammered on the 3 walls in the closet. Over time the wood (which is particle board for some reason) has bent down in the middle given there is no support.

I'm thinking to replace these shelves either with either higher quality wood, or better yet metal wire shelves of similar size (maybe 24"" x 77""), but they need to be reinforced to avoid warping. Alternatively yank the studs out and put up a new shelving system.

Any suggestions? I have mostly boxes, tech stuff, (house stereo etc.,) and other things to put in the closet.",2,1,HomeImprovement,675

nfl8cc,Double picketing a fence,"My neighbors and I are planning a fence between our back yards. I had heard that upgrading your posts to 4x6 would provide enough stability/support for both sides of the fence to be picketed. So we agreed to pay an additional upfront cost ($350 extra for 8 posts - which is another issue...) to the contractor. 

Now the contractor is saying to orient the 4x6s so that the wider side will be facing out, rather than facing towards the posts on each side. This seems counterintuitive. My understanding was that the extra wood was to support the added mass of pickets and prevent wind and force applied to the picket sides of the fence. Am I wrong?

So far we've gotten 3 hard quotes and one soft quote (waiting for them to come out in two weeks)

&#x200B;

Two masons that came out quoted between 3,850 and 4,250 to lay the top layer of bricks, build up a foot and pour a new crown. Cheaper is a local company that's been around 25 years with plenty of good reviews. They repaired the homes central chimney a decade ago for the previous owners. The more expensive one has no online presence or reviews and I only found him from a recommendation from a chimney sweep.

Two chimney sweeps gave two different quotes around the same prince for wildly different solutions. Hard quote was $1,625 for repair, metal chase cover and class-A chimney extension. Soft quote was \~$1,600 for full roof-up rebuild (3ft), with someone coming by for a full quote in two weeks. The one offering a full rebuild is local and has been around for 35 years with plenty of good reviews.

2. Closing most vents except a couple to concentrate the air flow to one location, and then cleaning that area thoroughly.
3. Going to attic and vacuuming the inside of the hose with a shop vac. 
4. Attaching some kind of filter to the air vents to catch any fiberglass that might blow into the room (but we have no idea what kind of filter that would be and if it would restrict air flow causing the system to burn out. )

nfjbaa,Adding a patio that could HOPEFULLY double as a parking spot in small backyard. Thoughts?,"We have a house with a very small back yard with no real patio. The part of the backyard that extends from the house to the front of the garage is about 9 feet by 26 feet, and slopes upward about 14 inches off the back of the house (about 7.5 degrees incline). 

What I'd like is to flatten this area of the backyard and turn it into a flat and very simple patio, with a retaining wall, but what I'd LOVE is to have the area also double as a parking spot.

[https://imgur.com/a/9aLkvbK](https://imgur.com/a/9aLkvbK)

The biggest problem is the incline. While the driveway is wide enough to be able to pull my car into that spot (and the ""parking spot"" itself, at 9 feet wide, is wide enough to park into), the 14"" drop at its tallest point would be impossible for my car to get into or out of.

As far as I can tell, here are my options. I'd love your opinions on which of these is most feasible, and which ones are not feasible at all.

1) Have a hump that smooths out that steep drop. Not sure how spread out of a hump it'd have to be to be usable, it might eat into the patio quite a bit.

2) Can I raise the entire patio to split the difference (like 8 inches up, with gradual incline on the low point, and a gradual decline off the high point)? To do this we'd have to build into the back of the house (and I wouldn't want it to NOT be attached to the house, or else there'd be a ditch there). I'm not sure if that's possible.

3) Ditch the parking spot idea altogether. This would suck, as eventually we have plans to turn my half of the garage into an office, and I'd love to be able to park my car without tandeming.",1,0,HomeImprovement,1624
nfj824,A little confused about whether I should use 1/4 minus or (5/8 or 3/4) minus for paver and retaining wall base,"So I'm planning on landscaping a retaining wall and a paver patio. Most recommendations I've read online suggesting using 3/4 minus over 1/4 minus, although there are a few recommendations for either. For the purposes of this comparison, I'm assuming 5/8 is comparable to 3/4 which is what is offered around me. 

Reddit Examples:  
 * [Retaining wall - 1 rec for 1/4, 2 for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/60s6r7/what_kind_of_gravel_can_i_use_as_a_base_for_my/)

 * [Retaining wall - rec for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/j6txde/two_retaining_wall_questions_should_i_try_and/)

 * [Paver - rec for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/99n3q7/question_on_which_of_these_to_use_for_base_of/)  
 * [Paver - rec for 3/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/a3fh3m/help_what_to_use_as_base_under_paver_patio/)  

The problem I'm having trouble reconciling is that at almost every topsoil vendor I look at, they say that 1/4 is used as a base and that 5/8 is used for pathways and driveways. Considering 5/8 is slightly smaller than 3/4, I don't see how this doesn't stand up favorably to the recommendations I'm seeing. 

Example: http://nwlandscapesupply.com/products/crushed-rock/  
 * ""Crushed Rock – 1/4″ minus: Perfect for under pavers and flagstone...""  
 * ""Crushed Rock – 5/8″ minus: Compactable base material used for driveways and pathways.""  

Example: https://www.sbsg.com/products/sbsg-bulk-aggregates/  
 * ""Our 1/4″ minus crushed gravel contains crushed aggregate that is 1/4″ to dust. It packs very tightly and offers better compaction and stability as a base for pavers, retaining walls...""  
 * ""Washed 5/8 Minus Crushed Gravel. Also referred to as “CSTC” or Crushed Surface Top Coarse. This crushed gravel is primarily used for driveways and walkways.""  

A couple others mention 5/8 for use with retaining walls, but not pavers. 1/4 is often recommended for pavers. If I were to pick one mix for both paver base and wall base (< 4'), should it be 1/4 or 5/8? Should I be using 1/4 for pavers and 5/8 for the wall ideally? I'd rather use the same so I'm not requiring multiple deliveries. Am I overthinking this and either would be fine?

I posted in LegalAdvice as well, but since I originally posted this contractors work here I figured I’d ask if anyone had experience this situation before. 

** Problem:
Had no written contract with contractor. Wasn’t happy with work contractor did. Froze credit card so that they wouldn’t prematurely charge me before work was completed. Now contractor has disabled all phone numbers associated with their company. Pretty sure I was scammed. **

Can they come back months/years and force me to pay them?

————————

Summary: 
I hired a chimney contracting company based off of first search on Google (first mistake). 

I did successfully pay them $129 for an inspection in which I said I needed my crown replaced and mortar between the bricks. They told me it would cost $1200 but I never got a written contract as to them agreeing what work will be done (second mistake). 

They came by three days later and added mortar in between the bricks but they did not professionally add a new crown. I told the contractor I had a problem with this and they said to call management. Before he left I called management saying I had problem with the job and they said that they will get another tech out there to review the work the next day. I felt a little off so I quickly froze my credit card. Not 1 hour later a charge of $1200 came through and was declined because I froze my card. (Only right thing I did). 

Management called me back ( obviously because I haven’t paid them) and said that they will try their best to rectify the problem. This was 5 days ago. 

As of last Friday all phone numbers associated with their company have been disabled and just keeps ringing for 5 min+. I have tried everyday twice a day and nothing. 

I’m pretty sure I was scammed. What am I liable for? I changed my credit card info so they can’t charge me unknowingly. But do I need do do anything so that I’m not liable for charges? (I’m not looking for my $129 back I know that’s long gone)",31,85,HomeImprovement,2333

nffsn2,Project post - partial first floor makeover: Paint and floors refinishing,"https://imgur.com/a/MzaRfHb - link to album. 

TL:DR 

Painted main floor and kitchen grey (SW Grey Screen #7071, cashmere flat) from beige and changed floors from natural stain and gloss finish to a grey/dark brown (75% Jacobean/25% aged barrel minwax stain) and Bona mega one satin water based polyurethane finish. Replaced couch.

After about a year in the builder beige main floor we wanted to change things up to a lighter color and more modern look. Decided on a light tone grey, which sent us down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out the right grey. After looking at about 12-15 greys, gray screen, which is a cool blue undertone grey won out. Spent a few days in my spare time running around putting drywall mud over the numerous nail holes and any really bad spots. The drywall is in not the best shape and whoever did the initial taping and mudding did not know how to do butt joints because you can see every piece of drywall and where it starts and ends. Also nail holes. I didn’t bother filling those in since I am bit lazy and most people don’t notice it as much as me. After spackling I went over the wall with a 9” sander to level everything a bit and knockoff old drips and ridges. Take off outlets, vent covers, thermostats, doorbells ringers, security things, curtains/blinds, etc. Don’t be that homeowner!

This was the 2nd paint endeavor of the house and this time around I watched a lot more video on how to cut properly and it paid off a lot. In the rooms I did before the cutting was sloppy and best and this time it was pretty good, with only a few area that are ""too much"" on the ceiling.

Cost breakdown:

5 gallons cashmere: ~$240 – there’s a lot leftover for touchups.

Assortment of brushes (angled and straight) and rollers (3/8” nap 9”), extension poles, sanding pole and sheets ~$100

Aluminum work platform for cutting in ceiling: $79

We were quoted about 650 for labor only on this job, would have been reasonable but with 3 people the job was done in a day.  


Floors: $2.50/sqft – $1250 total
While I enjoy DIY projects and don’t hire out much, sanding the floors and refinishing was not something I wanted to do. Emailed about 7 different floor refinishers in the area for quotes. 4 got back to me, 1 came out and 3 gave estimates with pictures. The area is only about 450 sq ft and is one big rectangle with 2 small “hallways” for doors in/out and to basement with a closet. Quotes came in between 2.40-3.25 sqft. 
When talking with the contractors it was important to see what was included in the base price and what was extra. Some places charged more for trendy colors like white/grey/black, others charged more for custom blending, or a 3rd poly coat. 


Once we had the date picked the process was 2 days, 1 for sanding and staining, 1 for final poly coats. The house smelled pretty bad for about a week after and it lingers for a week or two after that. 

Finishing touch was the couch, which fits the area much more nicely that the large sectional which took up a ton of room on the front wall near the bay window. 

Total cost for the project (including couch): approximately 2569

Last winter I asked the same guy I dealt with before, what would happen to my warranty if I got more roof vents installed in the spring. He said their company would have to do the work if I want to keep the warranty. I was fine with that.

So I recently called them and said I wanted to get some vents installed. I also told them that I am  re-insulating the attic, and I want to get the vents done while there's no insulation in the attic. That way I can more easily install rafter chutes, ie baffles, ie insulation stops. They set up an appointment to do an estimate. I waited all that day and they didn't show. I called them and they apologized - said the technician was really busy and would try to drop by the next day after the job he was on. He did not drop by; I called back again: more apologies, another promise. I also learned that in making all these arrangements, I had been dealing with one person whom I assumed to be some sort of secretary. But in fact their title is, ""Health and Safety Administrator/Service Manager/Special Projects Manager"" Then they failed to show a third time. 

All this took about two weeks. I called them back, determined to get an explanation. Their story had now changed: The job is very complicated.

I've googled around and cannot find a doorknob like this.  The only screws seem to be on the latch tube, and removing them does nothing of course.

The knobs on both sides of the door are identical in every way.  But one side has a gap between the plate and the door that I can fit a tool inside, but I can't find any obvious way to use that to remove the knobs if that's how I'm supposed to do it.

The little paperclip thing on the bottom was holding the faceplate on. The little rectangle hole on the side had some sort of latch that I had to press in with an Allan wrench while my wife pulled on the knob as hard as she could. The knob probably was easier to remove when it was newer, but now it's really rusted.

I think I may have broken the latch that holes the knob on, but that's okay, if I did break it, I was considering replacing all the knobs in the house that are like this anyway, because they are all ancient, rusted, and kinda get stuck a lot.

nfdjvd,Backyard pipe,"When we originally moved in the previous owners had a 6-in pipe coming out from the backyard between the patio and deck. On top of this pipe they had a planter box. The planter box was old and deteriorating so we removed it.

nfclxr,[Question] Sealing around copper radiant heating baseboards and the floor?,"Hi There,

We have a house with radiant heat and due to some recent work in the basement have realized just how much dust blows up through the opening that lets the hot water piping up from the basement. On the main floor we have radiant hot water baseboards in almost every room so there are quite a few spots where there are drilled holes in the floor. 

Is this something that could be sealed safely? Since hot water runs through the piping, I wouldn't want to put anything there that might melt or be a fire hazard. I would also be in favor of something that would be removable (like a rubber washer) in case any baseboards needed particular repair. The gap in most places is pretty small (less than 5 mm).

nfc24c,HVAC Condensate into Sealed Sump Pit? Alternatives?,"We just bought our first home. Just after getting the keys I purchased an AirThings radon monitor and installed it in the basement where my readings averaged about 2.8-3.4 pcl. Fast forward 2-3 weeks, a few days before we were set to move in, the reading has shot up to the low 5's. I've researched sealed sump pit lids and am confident I can install a lid, fan, and all the necessary PVC plumbing to exhaust it outside above the roof line like it should be.

I want to DIY this if it's at all feasible, but I also don't want to waste time & money and not see any improvement.

So, a couple questions;

* My natural gas furnace's condensate line drains into the open sump pit. Can't really seal a condensate line as-is, it goes straight down to the floor and then gravity takes it the \~30-40' to the pit. **Could I drain the condensate line into a sealed sump pit lid if I install a P-trap on the condensate line?**
* I also have a dehumidifier draining by drip hose into the sump well. I can move that to another corner of the basement where there's a floor drain, where the W/D go into the city sewer (this drain is also equipped with a backflow preventer system). **For purposes of radon mitigation, I assume this drain is fine as-is since it's porous and goes into the city sewer?**
* The house was built in 1942, and at some point a crew came in here & apparently installed some tile drain. The west wall and south wall have non-original concrete poured, and a sort of egg-crate looking dimpled material between the wall & the poured foundation. Since the same non-original concrete surrounds the sump pit and the floor drain into the sewer, this work was probably all done at the same time. **Does this grey plastic/foam baffling/egg-crate material need sealed if I seal the sump pit? Should I just seal the sump pit and see if my radon levels go down, or do we know for sure that this will be a ""half measure""? If I seal it & create negative pressure in those drain tiles, will I be drawing air into a PVC tile from the basement through the baffles instead of the radon under the slab?**

nfc11w,The distance between two vertical planks in a porch skirt,"I'm building a porch skirt with pvc trim board. The boards will be oriented vertically, almost like a fence. I need to add ventilation by spacing the boards apart, but 1/4"" spacing is looking a bit ""gap tooth""-sh.

nfc047,Re-routing dryer vent. Opinions/advice?,"So my laundry room is on the top floor. Currently, the dryer vent runs up a wall, and when it reaches the attic it turns horizontal and exits out the side of the house (approximately where the orange arrow is in the pic). The total length if the vent is probably over 30 feet, with one 90 degree bend.

About once a year the lint builds up and I need to clean out the vent. Problem is, because of the slope of my lot I can't reach exit point from the outside (it's pretty high up, even my extension ladder is too short). There isn't much I can do from the inside either, especially since most of the buildup is near the exit and it's 30+ feet away from where the dryer connects inside. So my only option is to climb in the attic, disassemble the vent, bring each section outside for cleaning, then reassemble it in the attic. Obviously this is not ideal and it's compounded by the fact that the vent is buried beneath a good two feet of insulation.

What I'd like to do is re-route the vent out the back of the house. The laundry area is near the exterior wall, so running the vent this way would be very easy and I already have an idea of how I would route it and finish it off inside. Option A would be to run the vent beneath the ceiling, and it would exit near the soffit where the red dot is in the pic. The green dot represents Option B, which would be to keep the vent lower and have it exit probably a few feet below the soffit. If I hug the floor I'd actually be a couple feet lower than the green dot. With either of these options, I'd still have a 90 degree bend but the total run would be under 12 feet. So the advantages of these options are that the total length of the vent is much shorter, and I can make it so that it's easily accessible if/when it needs to be cleaned periodically.

Here's where I'm looking for opinions/advice. I do have soffit vents that provide ventilation for my attic. Obviously I don't want all that moisture from the dryer vent to get pulled into my attic through the soffit vents. How close is too close to the soffit?


TLDR; Id like to re-route my dryer vent so that I do not have to go through my attic to clean the vent. The new exit would be on the exterior wall, but in close proximity to a soffit vent. How far beneath the soffit should I plan on placing the vent so that moisture from the vent does not get pulled into my attic?

Remodelling the kitchen to have cooker on outside wall would involve too much expense and complications ... moving the entrance door for example and the knock on effects that have on the living room.

nf1yx2,Bitumen roof leaking around brick chimney.,"What can I do with this leaking chimney?
https://imgur.com/a/vPo2zo6

**TL;DR: Can I retrofit flashing somehow if there is none?**

The roof is bitumen/tar, coated with a silver/metallic reflective layer. The roof overall seems in good shape, it was put on about five years ago, it seems whoever did the roof decided to cover the brick chimney with tar at the same time, the chimney was completely covered in tar/roofing cement, which has dried up and is pulling away from the brick, I started pulling the tar off to see what was behind, and sure enough it was wet and moldy. The uncovered part is what I have exposed so far.

I am not sure whether there is flashing under the tar at the bottom part of the chimney, I hope there is.

My plan is to remove the tar on the top part of the chimney, repoint the brickwork and then seal the brick with a paint-on drylok siloxane masonry sealer.

My concern is what to do around the bottom part/flashing area. How low should I go pulling off the tar? If I find no flashing as I go down, what can I do?

Is it possible to retro-fit flashing *over* the existing built-up-roof, with additional layers of bitumen and cement on top of the new flashing? Or instead would I need to pull up the roof around the chimney all the way down to the sheathing in order to install flashing?

Thanks very much for any advice.

nf1tpo,Tankless water heater flush Newbie,"My Navien tankless water heater threw an Error 46 a few days ago. I could not find much on Error 46, high limit error other than a flush might help. I thought it was a long shot,  but for a $100 bucks. The last time this thing blew a valve, it was $300 to repair and the part was under warranty.  I can only imagine what it will cost to replace a $5 limit switch.

So I bought all of the Vinegar in Wally World, some washing machine hoses and a utility pump. The hot water shutoff is jammed and washing machine hoses don't quite work. The connections for the hoses are too shallow,  so even over tightening the hoses still left a slight dribble on the hot connection. I think two washers might solve the problem. Seems like a scam to prevent the homeowner from doing it themselves. 

I turned off the gas, pulled the plug, turned off the water, attached my water hoses and opened the drain valves to drain the water into my bucket. I drained my bucket, added three gallons of vinegar and started my pump. I had to tighten my hoses a bit more, but the hot still dribbled. Any tighter and I would snap off those cheap ass valves.

nf1ome,How should I get drip line into and across cement patio i'm about to pour,"So I need to demolish and pour a concrete patio. Since we're doing it we want to run a drip line that will go to 2 planter boxes and a 2nd zone drip line that will go to a tree. The issue is the garbage cans are kept in an alley that the drip line needs to cross.

So far I have 3 ideas on how this could be done based on my search for similar projects or solutions.

[Option 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9yKPF2ulPhTmVvu623Wks-ybIQWx3un/view?usp=sharing)

A 90° 3/4"" pipe straight down. Run in the dirt under the cement to the end of the cement and then back up through it to connect a battery powered 2 zone drip line to.  I'm thinking Galvanized steel pipe as I'm concerned PVC could get broken somehow and if it happens at ground level, there'd be no way to connect anything to it so it would be all for not.

[Option 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wjDuwzUxs1Z-8AeUY8IvL9MA-_xCiP1w/view?usp=sharing)

The alley cans are in is slightly higher than the cement patio, I could run a 1 1/2"" steel pipe on top of the cement and sort of make a cement ramp over it. So I could run the 2 drip lines along walls, through the pipe at ground level and then along fence to yard.

Option 3

Basically same design as option 1 but with large plastic schedule 40 PVC pipe (1 1/2""?). Most of the suggestions online say to  push drip lines through PVC below ground. But this is usually in a straight line under a path or driveway and not something that has to go horizontally into ground in at least 1 location. My concerns with this is 90° even if it was a large PVC may cause lines to get fold and block. Or that I will not be able to thread it back through the PVC if something went wrong with the lines. In this case though, PVC outlet could at least be flush with cement.

Open to other options if there's a better one, but which option is the best? My primary concern is it's fixable or will last 30 years. Cost isn't too much of a deciding factor but the tools involved in pex seem to make it more cost effective to do metal. But not concerned about the difference between 16' and 2' of metal or how much cheaper plastic schedule 40 would be. Ease of install, a bit of a factor as I mess up plumbing when I've touched it before.

nezj7g,Builder can't get out detached garage location right,"Just wanted to vent and see what people think of this. 

Doing renovations, and a big portion of the project is having the builder put up a detached garage in our rear yard. The original plan shows it meeting the 6' side yard requirement, *including* the eaves which project 18"" off the side. So the foundation sits about 2' away from the 6' sideyard, or 8' off the lot line. 

They had it staked out, and I noticed that the corner of the building was staked out 6' from the lot line. I pointed it out to to the builders on site, and they kinda hand waved and said don't worry about it, but I was concerned that the eaves were going to project 18"" into the side yard. I've heard of buildings being torn down in our area for this exact problem. 

Regardless, we had to move the structure back a few feet and change the orientation slightly, so they had it moved and re-staked and re-surveyed. Well lo and behold, the stakes are STILL 6' off the lot line, and the survey now only shows the foundation, not the eaves as the original one did. Clearly we're going to violate the setback by 18"". So I told them not to start digging until it was correct. 

Now he's giving me a decent amount of pushback. He's claiming it's my fault for not telling them where we want the building etc. I told him we just want it to be in compliance with zoning, and in response he sent me a completely incorrect zoning regulation (I basically know them by heart at this point) saying we had a 3' side yard (seriously... way off). Says ""we just build it, it's your job to tell us where"", being pretty snarky actually. He's telling me to just tell them where we want the thing as though it's somehow my indecision that's holding them up.

What's the appropriate response here? I actually want to tell them to completely fuck off and go find another builder, but not sure if that's overkill?

ney9t0,Why is Hot Water Heater T&P valve opening?,"Background: Hot water heater is 11 years old, I am original owner. Through its life, have replaced the T&P valve 3 times (most recently a few months ago). I have replaced the cold water intake expansion tank once (few months ago). It’s always seemed a little odd. Have had plumber come to house recently and pressure to my house has been right about 50psi. 

What’s happening: T&P will open and leak out maybe 1-2 gallons of water, but this only seems to occur if I’m away for a weekend or longer, and the water hasn’t been used in a few days.  It maybe has happened once when I’ve been home but by and large it’s when water isn’t even being used. Plumber recommended new expansion tank and T&P which I did and still the problem persists. Once in April when I was away for 2 nights. Then last week when I was gone for a week, BUT before I left I turned the temp of the hot water heater way down.  That makes me think this is a pressure related issue.

Going forward: Only things that remain to replace are: 1) house pressure regulator or 2) whole hot water heater. My fear is I replace the hot water heater and still have the same damn problem. But on the other hand the house pressure seems correct when tested. I will say sometimes when I flush a toilet and the tank is refilling it seems like the water flow sounds different/ stronger, like a momentary higher pressure. Talking with others in my neighborhood no one else seems to have this issue so pressure idea seems wrong.

ney5mg,What insulation should I use?,"TLDR:  What insulation should I use to replace the R-11 fiberglass insulation we had in basement studs that are 1 inch away from a cement wall in most areas, and right up to insulating sheathing and brick in another section.?

Hi all, just looking for a little advice.  We have been living in our new home for about a year now and I noticed that a baseboard in the basement looked like it had mold growing. Sure enough when I pulled it off I found a good bit of rot and mold.  I pulled the wall apart and a lot of the insulation was a bit moldy and discolored, so I removed it all.

[https://imgur.com/9rKj9Ag](https://imgur.com/9rKj9Ag)

This is all the wall I'm going to pull apart for now, the damage doesn't seem to extend any further, and to be honest it's not too bad considering. Studs are in good shape just stained. I've already got it pretty dried out and I'm going to bleach treat the wood. I've cut the bottom of the 1980's paneling off, I'll replace just this bottom 2-3inches with similar 1980's paneling and replace/cover with new baseboard.  I think this is a better fix than trying to find a matching replacement for the whole paneling, and in a few years I would like to drywall this space, so it good enough for now.  At that time I'll redo the insulation in the whole space. I've also pretty much determined the cause, and it a combination of its-so-dumb-it's almost comical things:

The downspout for the gutter terminates at this far corner onto a cement runner that should direct water away from the house.  That runner didn't exactly fit under the downspout and so whoever put it there probably 10 years ago put it backwards and said good enough.  It literally directs water towards the house (facepalm). [https://imgur.com/D9xLDMQ](https://imgur.com/D9xLDMQ)

It gets better, whoever installed the landscaping sprinkler controller ran the wires through the wall and into a PVC pipe that runs on a downgrade from the garden to the wall.  The PVC terminates right behind where the gutter ends, no effort was made to seal any of this.  When the gutter back flows into that area water runs down the PVC and follows the wires through the wall. [https://imgur.com/qN0ADrD](https://imgur.com/qN0ADrD)

I'll address these issue with downspout extensions, removing the PVC and sealing the holes. The cement the AC units are on here are actually downgraded away from the house so water naturally does move away from the foundation.

So for the insulation, I was going to just replace in kind with some R-13 of the same style, but it obvious to me that fiberglass insulation is not always the recommended choice for basements so I wanted to see what a better choice would be. I assume a foam board maybe?  Not sure if that makes sense to just put into the studs. A few things to note:

1) The cement wall behind the studs has some sort of spray coating, and there is a runner at the bottom. As I understand this runner is supposed to direct water away from the foundation I guess? (this is what my inspector told me way back). Seen in this photo: [https://imgur.com/JEhW3JU](https://imgur.com/JEhW3JU)

ney0er,Moldy attic Remediation,"Hi,

Not sure if this is the right place for this. I am a first-time house owner living in Washington state the house is 19 years old and know that some mold in the attic is commonplace for this area. However, just had a mold inspector come to the house and they found a lot of black mold all over the roof of the attic. To the point they need an air respirator, they do not do abatement so there should not be any conflict of interest I think. They have not come back with the report yet, so no pictures at the moment.

They said there are a few things I have to do;

Get my bath ventilation inspected to ensure there are no leaks,

Get my roof inspected to see if there are any issues,

Get my attic ventilation inspected to see if there is good airflow,

Get the mold in the attic treated,

Remove and replace all the insulation.

I have been looking around to see what is the best way to approach this, from what I have read so far is should I hire a house inspector so they can come in to check the bath ventilation, attic ventilation, and a roof inspection. Then get hire a team to come in and get rid of the mold and remove and replace the insulation. Then depending on the issue that the inspector finds; hire someone to fix the roof or the ventilation.

So my question what is the best way to approach this situation?  Could I do the inspection myself?  Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!",1,5,HomeImprovement,1425

newbka,Tankless gas vs Heat Pump Hot water Heater,"Amazing redditors,

I am trying to figure out whether or not to go with a tankless gas hot water heater or a heat pump hot water heater. The installation would be in the mechanical section of a half finished basement with the furnace for the central AC that is somewhat damp (and maybe two dehumidifiers to help control the moisture). We are a family of 5 people and would say we have a moderate to high hot water demand. Currently, we have a 40 gallon gas hot water heater and we run into issues if we run the dishwasher and everyone takes showers in the evening.

I am guessing we would be okay on a 65 gallon heat pump hot water heater but I am leaning towards 80 gallon if we go for the heat pump which would make it less efficient.

The way I am thinking about this is that heat pump hot water heater would dehumidify the basement and take the place of the dehumidifiers. This would also cool the basement in the summers and borrow heat from the furnace in the winters. My guess is that on dehumidifying I am going to spend two hundred dollars per year. It will also heat the house in the summer when I would likely be using it the most.

Our electricity cost here is pretty high at 25c per KWH.  Natural gas prices are about $14 per 1000 cu feet also quite high.

I taped a piece of foil to the floor for several days and just peeled it up and it was perfectly dry underneath.  So...was that a pointless test or does that mean I don't need poly on the floor?  I have no idea if there is a vapor barrier UNDER the concrete slab but if there was would that negate the need for poly on top of the floor?

1. Trees near the leach field were cut as I was informed it could mess up the grid.
2. Drain field risers were installed on all ends & each port was hydro jetted.

It's been about a year since and I noticed I am still getting lush growth of grass along the drain lines again. On top of that, I noticed lush growth at the ends of all risers.

Logically speaking, it \*should\* be normal for the area on top of a leach grid to receive much better nutrient hence better growth of grass right? Google tells me otherwise and deems this as a early sign of septic failure.

This morning, I found out they had no intention of touching it. I called the office and they agreed to replace it (as it was stated in the quote).

Am I crazy if I don't want to accept it the way it is? Here are my issues:

- The color. My HOA is very particular about color matching, so if they find out this section is now white they could fine me $50 a day until it's fixed. Almond versus driftwood I could get away with, but they went from black to white.

- The shingles were cut way too short. They used to go all the way to the edge of the water channel. Now they were cut 8 inches shorter for some unknown reason. And the cut seems very sloppy.

- The seams where it meets the gutter. No idea what that is or what is sealing it, but I am concerned it will fail much sooner than the rest of the roof. This is above my living room.

I called the roofer's office and at first thing they said is that they'd have someone call me to ""explain it better"". I'm not interested in an explanation, I just want it done the way I specified 4 months ago. But I also don't want to be rude - they have been good to work with so far.

Basically I have a retaining wall built of stacking stones - Allen Blocks. Tons of resources and info out there and looks like a great product. I had original plans to build walls under 4' and spaced >6' apart but was talked into a ~5.5' wall moved further back which gave me more usable space. Unfortunately permitting is not the problem I'm worried about, but that is a different problem.

The thing I'm worried about is that the wall does not have proper drainage in my opinion. There's about 2"" of 57 stone mixed with crushed rock serving as foundation on top of packed, dense Georgia clay. For those unfamiliar, clay does not drain well or... really at all. Besides this there is 57 in the cavities of the blocks themselves but no backfill behind the wall besides what spilled over from shoveling. Now I know this is incorrect construction and though there is not much stress on this wall, I'm worried about drainage. Damage is done for the project and I don't expect my contractor to help with any code updates considering he skipped a permit. 

My question is if it's feasible to dig out behind the wall and backfill with gravel. The clay breaks easily enough with a mattock and the rest is just shovelling. Am I fucked because of the small foundation (should be 10""+ deep for a wall this size)? Will adding drainage behind and a perf. pipe save the long term viability of my wall?

ner2a6,New Paver Patio,"Completed a new brick paver patio project this spring! https://imgur.com/a/ys2oZkn.

Completed project = ~$1400

* Bricks + Delivery =	750
* Gravel + Sand + Delivery =	350
* Heavy landscape cloth =	70
* Play sand =	4
* Plastic Edging and stakes =	40
* 3-day compactor rental =	150
* 4-hr concrete saw rental =	55

First time building a patio so I ended up watching a lot of different youtube videos and read a few blogs from other DIY folks out there.  The steps are all pretty straightforward.  Essentially you need under a paver 4-6"" of compacted base + 1"" of sand and you need to ensure a 1.5 - 2% roll off for water.  From there, it's all in the execution.  

1. Cleared the site + 3"" on the open edges for the plastic edging to be staked in
2. Set stakes in all 4 corners and ensure you're square
3. (Set the lines)  There are different ways to do this but I found the low point, make the line level, then increase the high side by the amount needed to reach 2% roll-off.  
4. Repeat and double, triple check
5. Measure under the lines and ensure the ground itself is even as possible w/o any organic matter like roots in it
6. Run a compactor over the dirt to eliminate any air pockets made from digging
7. Lay down ground cloth
8. Fill in your gravel base and compact.  I didn't have a super heavy compactor so I filled and compacted in 2 layers
9. Check your gravel for slope.  I used a straight 2x4 with and taped an offset to it that signified the slope I should achieve. If I placed a level on top of the 2x4 and it was flat then I knew my roll-off was correct.  I went over the whole surface fanning out from the house/sunroom corner 
10. Drop down some .75"" pvc and screeded sand.  **""Why did you use .75 inch pvc when you said 1"" of sand?""**  Don't forget most pipes are sold by their inner diameter! If I used a 1"" pvc, there would've been too much sand
11. After screeding, start dropping in pavers
12. After all the bricks are in, stake down the edging, and run the compactor over it
13. Sweep in some play sand and call it a day

Hopefully that's enough detail! Let me know if you have any questions about the process.  Lastly, a **big** help for me to keep the costs down was to use 2nds from the brick supplier.  They had a whole yard full of returns or mistints so I was able to get the pavers for a dramatically cheaper price.  Instead of $5.50 per sq ft, I got it for $1.10.  Since I wasn't picky about the final look I got 80% off the bricks",15,64,HomeImprovement,2465

New homeowner. Florida. 

Noticed some nail pops along our drywall, cut into it and yup, water. The nail pops are in multiple locations around our home.

Had a leak detector out, he told us it was because our weep screed between floors was incorrectly sealed. 

Had stucco company come out, they said weep screed isn’t the issue, but our expansion joints need to be sealed and there’s some cracks.

Had envelope inspectors come out because can someone just tell me what’s wrong, and they said it’s the windows, plus a few other things. They said all windows need to be resealed around edges and screws, the cracks need to be sealed, and we are missing mullion on two windows. They also noticed that there needs to be some sealing between the roof and stucco, and part of our roof flashing isn’t long enough.

Sounds like an easy fix, but we have evidence of existing leaks around most windows, and we learned not to trust the prior owners work. There’s evidence of old patching around a few windows. Also, our baseboards were recently replaced which is now a red flag instead of a selling point...

neq7am,How to deal with gate that no longer opens/closes on new fence.,"We had a cedar shadowbox fence installed in our backyard in September. The install was delayed by 2 months due to supply issues related to COVID. After they told us about the delay, the communication from the owner and his main assistant (I believe his sister) took an absolute nose dive. I was very patient because I knew COVID was probably wreaking havoc on their business, but I would hear absolutely nothing from them unless I badgered them. They finally contacted me in September and gave me 1 day notice that they could schedule my fence install, and luckily I was able to arrange to be off work. The crew did a good job and once the fence was done I was of course happy with the product but also happy I'd never have to deal with them again.

Unfortunately, one of the gates we had installed started to no longer open/close around February, so less than 6 months after the install. It looks like one of the fence posts has sunk 3-4 inches which has caused the latch to be completely off and the door to not have room to swing freely in the frame. It did have some adjustment on the post bracket of the latch so I moved it by a half inch, but this only helped for a day and it's only gotten worse. I feel like the fence contractor should fix this, as it's been less than 6 months and the gate no longer functions, and the cost of a gate is factored into the price of the project.

I have been in contact with them, and the communication is once again abysmal. If you call their number, they state they're too busy to communicate by phone and to just email them. They've responded and say they want to fix the gate, but it has been over 2 months and they haven't arranged anything. They sent their crew to my house one morning without providing any notice, and my wife and I were both at work. It's difficult because I work in healthcare and can't usually just take off work with no notice, and with their godawful communication there's little chance they're going to actually give a scheduled time in advance. It seems like the owner and assistant simply don't talk to each other and she only responds if I continually bother her. I sent a strongly worded email 3 weeks ago and she was apologetic and claimed ""Owner asked me to keep on him and not let him forget about your gate, we promise we want to fix it"". I heard nothing for 2 weeks, emailed for an update last week and it's been crickets.

I need this gate to work, but I don't want to open it right now at all because I need it to be able to close so my dog doesn't get out. I'm worried the latch is eventually going to snap. I feel like my options at this point are to keep badgering the company and hope I get lucky that they actually act professionally and either fix it or at least go ahead and tell me to go to hell, hire another company to repair it, or fix it myself.

What actually is the fix for this problem? Is there something they would be able to do to jack the post up and align it properly again? I found that you can get a turnbuckle repair kit to fix sagging gates, but should I expect to have to install that on nearly a brand new fence? Is it simply moving the latch and/or hinges? If it's simply adjusting the latch I can do that, but how do I know the post isn't going to sink further? I'm also a bit bothered by the unevenness of it and if that's fixable I'd rather it be done right. Thanks for any advice, and if you're in the Northern Virginia area and want to know which fence contractor to avoid at all costs, just pm me.

I would like black exteriors, and have started looking for contractors. One has told me he refuses to sell black exterior vinyl windows because of how they can flake and distort due to our Southeast climate & sun. I have read other people experiencing this as well. This made me think I had to go with fiberglass, but there are very few companies around here that install fiberglass windows. The ones that do use Marvin Infinity windows. I am skeptical of Marvin as I see they had a class action lawsuit. I also don't like the limited warranty. If I am paying a lot of money for a product, I want to make sure the basics are covered -- and it seems to me that Marvin doesn't even account for failures like premature air gaps, cracking, etc.

Should I consider black exterior vinyl windows that may be more prone to issues if the warranty is good (looking at Sunrise Windows Restoration line)? Is fiberglass better than vinyl for a black exterior despite the fact that the warranty may not be as good?

Regardless of material, I want to do this once. Considering how much windows cost, I want to be assured that if I have problems, there is a valuable warranty to assist with them -- especially considering that I am getting an exterior color that may have some issues.

nemktw,Help me diagnose why my bedroom is so HOT. 😢,"Background:  We're in a small 1 bedroom apartment with central air, powered by a heat pump system.  There's one register in the living room/kitchen, one register in the bedroom, and one register in the bathroom, all ceiling.  The guts of the system are installed in the ceiling in the bathroom, so that's where everything originates from.  The total duct distance from the guts of the system to the register in the bedroom is probably 20', if that.  It's a small apartment.  The total sqft is probably around 700sqft and the bedroom is around 16'x12', so around \~200sqft.  Hardwood floors throughout, ceiling height the same. 

Anyway.  Our bedroom gets SO HOT, compared to the rest of the apartment, and it's driving me crazy because I can't figure out why.  The air coming out of the register is cold and strong, just like in the rest of the apartment, but the temperature difference between the two rooms is dramatic.  Walking out into the living room is like walking into a refrigerator, whereas we struggle with sweating while we sleep in the bedroom.  

It's to the point where we keep taking the thermostat lower and lower, and then our AC system ices over and stops blowing, so we have to turn it off for a day to let it thaw, and we keep repeating that cycle.  In Washington DC the summers are HOT and HUMID, and it's only now getting hot enough to run the AC, but it's only going to get worse as we move into summer. 

We have a desk/office space in the bedroom as well as a TV, but these are all turned off at night (and not generating heat).  We have vinyl shades over the windows to keep the lights out at night and generally those partially attached during the day.  The bedroom has two large west-facing windows, whereas the living room has 3, also facing west on the same facade of the building.

Even during the day the bedroom is probably a few degrees warmer than the rest of the apartment, but it's very dramatic at night.

Maybe a crappy eyebolt? Maybe my kids and I swung a little hard on it *(hey it's fun!)*? 

I'm looking for advice on how ELSE I can hang a porch swing using two points in the roof beams of the porch. Is there some sort of metal bracing I can attach to the beams that would better resist lateral loads? 

Or maybe I should have screwed in the eyebolts directly flush to the wood? I believe I left a little of the eyebolt out of the wood, which in hindsight, probably allowed the lateral load to apply directly to the bolt.

neht5q,Convert rust into a primer with a paint? (I'm rehabbing a Weber grill!),"Good Morning, I've been working on rehabbing a Weber grill by using my drill and a wire brush to strip off loose paint on the body of the grill, an some rust.  It seems that without an a sander, angle grinder, or some such tool, I'm probably not going to get all the rust spots.  My understanding is that this means the rust will continue to eat away at the metal, albeit slowly, when covered with paint.  

I mentioned my concern to a friend, and noted my intention to re-paint the outside of the grill with Rustoleum High Heat Paint when finished, and they said not to worry b/c the Rustoleum actually converts rust and changes it to primer or something like that.  This sounded a bit too good to be true, but it got me thinking.

1. Is there a product that I can spray on the grill to convert or remove rust without doing something so extreme as grinding off a bunch of metal with a sander or angle grinder?
2. Will whatever I use stand up to high heat, or make the Rustoleum more likely to come off?",8,7,HomeImprovement,1003
nehlp0,Trying to put up a privacy screen on a vinyl fence.,"Hello everyone (located in Alberta 🇨🇦🍁). We have a vinyl fence and as such don't want to drill holes in it. We are struggling to find anything to use on top of the fence for a privacy screen. My husband's idea was to buy long rectangular plywood with a brick pattern on it and lean it against the fence providing about 2 feet of extra privacy on top. Im worried the plywood will just fall down when the wind picks up. As such I suggested we move them to the alley so we only see the top 2 feet privacy part. Then string them together and put steaks in the ground to hold them up. Possibly with a string going from a hole in the top to the otherside of the fence (into out yard) to counter balance it.
Just wondering if anyone has some ideas on a better solution. We can still return the plywood.

Problems:
1) I don't think the plywood will last and all the sheets together cost almost $500.
2) Buying the steaks and string will cost even more $$
3) Might look ugly with the strings going from the plywood to the steak in the ground.
4) might rub against the fence and scratch it.

nehgq7,Electric water heater stops working at random; fixed by turning safety switch off and on: electrical issue?,"In Quebec, Canada.

I have a 40-gallon electric water heater that has started to act up:

Every few days, we wake up with no hot water. The circuit breaker hasn't been  tripped. However, if turn the heater off and on from the safety switch ([pictured](https://imgur.com/haSJYcq)) next to the heater, it starts to work again--and also, the safety switch itself seems to start to make ""crackling"" sounds when turned back on.

My question: is this an electrical issue with the switch? If so, is it dangerous to continue using it? Or is it more likely the heater? The heater is a rental and we planned on getting rid of it this summer anyway (\~10 years old, was here when we moved in). But I'd hate to have a plumber come install a new heater just to find out it was the switch all along.

**EDIT**

**Thank you everyone for the advice. I shut off the breaker and had a look inside the switch: no loose wires, but the fuses were slightly loose; I tightened them. I do however notice some residue of burnt wire insulation (**[see picture](https://imgur.com/a/BCx53xF)**). Is this problematic, or just a sign of age? Thanks again.**

New air handler was installed in our attic in November. Drain pan installed underneath. Last night we hear dripping from the closet underneath the air handler, I go up and the drain pan is near full, it’s installed on a couple pipes instead of a level surface and the weight of the water caused the pan to tilt to one corner, causing the water spillage. The leak detection unit in the drain pan was clearly in contact with the water but I imagine it was installed incorrectly since
It didn’t trip. The unit was dripping constantly, we shut off the power and I started vaccing water out to solve the short term issue.

I don’t want the original installation company out here since they’re clearly incompetent, but I do think they’re responsible for the costs of fixing the unit and the water damage in our closet.

neg5vs,Leaking water heater (bottom of tank) only 5 years old,"I feel like I see water in my sleep now. We moved into our (old.) house three weeks ago and have been fixing some plumbing issues. The plumbers used my water heater to unclog a stack with high pressure water. It left a lot of water on the floor from when they opened the pipe clean out, and they cleaned up as best as they could. The next morning I went down and saw some water around the bottom of the tank. Thought maybe it was residual water. Cleaned it up and all good. Well, she seems to be leaking because there’s a small pool of water whenever we use hot water in the shower or washing machine. Photo attached. No issues with hot water at all; the leak seems to be coming from the bottom on the side, away from the valves. 

I am curious how long I can leave this leak without it becoming a much larger leak, based off of your experience if you have it. Also the timing of the leak seems...odd...you know, the day after they used it, but I’m not sure how it can be related.  It’s a 50 gallon tank that is only 5 years old, so I’m quite surprised it is leaking at all. No service records written on the log sheet, only the install date. Tank replacement is not an expense I really want to deal with right now because I have a big electrical and AC job coming up, and more plumbing. It’s in an unfinished basement so I don’t have immediate major water damage concerns, either.

I'm pretty okay with debris removal and crown repair, but the chimney is a double-flue and each flue is 40"" x 9"" (inside dims) with 3"" of crown separating them.  It seems like they are too close together for two caps (? maybe not ?), otoh, I can't find a single cap that is \~84"" x 12"" to span the flues and land in the crown.

Is there a standard solution for this? Could I use two caps butting together and caulk the joint, or would I have to get something fabricated?  Here are pictures w/dims for reference:

My parents had a 3-day power outage back in August 2020. Ever since then, half of the lights in their home start to flicker at weird hours, for hours on end. This is a noticeable and distracting flickering and their house seems to be the only one affected. It happens more towards the night but is not exclusive to that. 

We've had our local Electric Company go there multiple times and they've replaced the transformer, connections, wires, tightened things up, you name it. Every time they do, we get about 1-3 weeks of relief before it starts again. Eventually they said there was nothing else they could fix and it must be internal.

Our local electrician (that I used for my own house and they did a great job) went around testing a few things and said it would be best to just replace the whole service from the very top all the way to the box; just get rid of all of the variables of bad breakers, bus bars, and start fresh. A few days later it started again.

They came back and they've tested the lights having the issue and nothing is coming up. Everything looks tight and well connected. They tested breakers for load and shared neutrals and again nothing of notice. They are now in the process of installing a voltage recorder at the meter to see if they can find a voltage drop from the outside to see if it really is our house. 

Last night I used my own voltage meter at several outlets that were causing the problem with lamps, during the time of the flickering, and I saw nothing on my end. Just a steady 124-125v while staring at a flickering light.

Next, brush mastic to seal all joints except where the registers connect. Let mastic dry 72 hours.

Disconnect registers and feed sleeves the entire length of the ducting runs. Tape seams, reconnect registers & mastic the joints going to the registers. 

First, is this correct? 2nd., will the mastic be able to handle movement when I Disconnect the registers and sleeve? 

If the mastic can't hold before sleeving I was thinking about putting sleeves on but not taping so it's still loose and I could shuffle the sleeve around to mastic, and then tape so there would be no disconnecting required after mastic.",1,1,HomeImprovement,1029

In the process of cleaning up the place, we found a lot of standing water in the crawl space and around the concrete foundation.

We called two different large foundation stabilization companies to get quotes. Both found that one corner of the house is quite low... As much as 2.5 inches. TerraFirma proposed to install 11 piles at a cost of $27,500 or $2500 per pile. RamJack proposed to install 8 piles at a cost of $18,460 or $1995 per pile. (Both after the cost of permits and engineering).

One difference is that TerraFirma proposed to stabilize the second, slightly less settled corner of the house. While RamJack focused on the chimney, which I don't think TerraFirma even looked at. We didn't get to drill down on the differences with the RamJack rep because he was a lot more rushed, maybe because he knew it was our second quote, and maybe also because I, the male partner, wasn't there to engage with him.

I know that I need to attach a pressure treated sill to the top of the concrete foundation. I believe I have a few options: 1) attach my sill plate to the foundation and then use metal straps to attach the existing timber to the new sill plate when they set the house back down. 2) I could do the same as above, but also attach another board to the timber using long 6-8” screws and then set the house down. This way I can more easily cut out any rotten spots and fill them in. This would give me a double bottom plate for my sill. This would probably be best, but lumber prices are horrible right now. 3) I could attach my pressure treated sill plate directly to my existing timber and then set it down on my foam on top of the concrete foundation. This is what the guy who lifted the house said to do, but I don’t see how to attach the sill to the concrete.

[Here is a picture of the fixture](https://imgur.com/gallery/hPU3U2w)

Firstly, I believe Black A to be my hot wire as I first tried wiring as follows:

- Black A to Black (light)
- White A to White (light)
- Ground A to Ground (light).

This resulted in the light being lit at full brightness when the breaker was turned back on but it was not controlled by the switch.

From reading various help posts elsewhere, my understanding is that the following arrangement should have it work with the switch:

- Black A to White B
- Black B to Black (light)
- White A to White (light)

When I flip the breaker back on though, this results in the light being dimly lit and still not affected by the switch. 

Is there something I'm doing wrong with the ground wires that might be the source of my issue? I didn't think they should affect anything but that's about the only variable I haven't messed with at this point. There is a ground that comes from the B wire that is attached to the fixture (not the new bulb but the fixture that's inset in the ceiling in the pic) by a screw.

Today when removing some tile grout whitener the wife had used to make the grout look a bit whiter she noticed a tile was slightly out of position. I managed to get the entire tile out intact. I simply cut around the grout and was about to break the tile to remove it when I tried prying it and to my surprise it just lifted out.

The adhesive had previously been put on what looks like a cement backing board, but there has been slight water ingress and it looks like the backing just rotted and the tile lifted. The odd thing is after testing all the other tiles they all seem totally secure and not wanting to move. I now have a tile so clean that it looks like it came out of a box so can reinstall the original tile. My question is. How? Obviously, I can't just put adhesive straight onto that cement and all the other tiles have still adhered to the original surface. For the moment a new bathroom is not financially viable so I am asking what I can do to reinstall this tile into that gap, do I need a membrane here or can I use an adhesive straight onto that cement. I was thinking of using a small piece of kerdi just to give the tile some extra waterproofing (this may be overkill for such a small job?)

ndx2oj,Soup bone stuck in toilet-help?,"Edit: IT’S OUT! Thank you for all the suggestions. For us the solution was a combination of things mentioned here.

Poured lime out in the hole and left it for a bit. Came back up and with one twist it was out.

Long story short, fiancé tried flushing old soup down the toilet without realizing there was a bone in it. It is now jammed in there. Before we have to pull our toilet off, does anyone have any suggestions on how to get the bone out of the hole? You can reach it with your fingers but it’s really stuck in there.

ndx24p,Contractor top mounted an undermount farmhouse sink,"So we've had a contractor doing some kitchen and bathroom updates in our house. On Friday they put in a walnut butcher block counter top and a black farmhouse sink ([https://karran.com/qar-750-retrofit-farmhouse-apron-front-quartz-composite-34-inch-double-bowl-kitchen-sink-kit-in-black.html](https://karran.com/qar-750-retrofit-farmhouse-apron-front-quartz-composite-34-inch-double-bowl-kitchen-sink-kit-in-black.html)). I noticed it on Friday after the contractor had left, but when I looked closely it has a lip on the edge and I assumed it was correct, so it wasn't really an issue until my wife asked why it wasn't undermounted today. I think it looks fine the way it is, so mostly concerned with functionality and resale, since we will be selling in a couple of years. I've never sold a house and I don't know if anyone buying it would care. That being said, it's not the cheapest sink or counter on the market, so if it needs to change then I'd like to bring it up sooner rather than later with the contractor. Is this issue worth bringing up? I'm assuming the countertop would have to be completely replaced, and I wouldn't want to pay for the second one. I never talked to the contractor about under or top mounting the sink. There is also a drinking water filtration system under the sink which doesn't leave much room for moving things around.

1. Mold on the concrete. As you can see, there's a pretty extensive patch of mold next to the tub. I'm in the PNW, so this wasn't really too unexpected. So, is this a pretty straightforward treatment? I'm planning a bleach solution with TSP.
2. The concrete around the toilet flange is pitted, and not flat with the rest of the floor. There wasn't any apparent sign of leakage, so I think the seal is fine, but as long as I have it ripped apart is it worth it to patch the depression, or does it not matter much since the newly installed toilet and flooring will cover over it?
3. As you can see in the photos, there's a pretty significant amount of drywall crumbling at the base around about half of the bathroom. Can I just cut away the first couple feet of drywall and replace it, or is it a good idea to just rip out the walls to the studs and start fresh ?

Update: based on all the input I received, I decided to look for a centrifugal motor, variable speeds and options for a low CFM for days when I’m not frying.

I considered Broan BWP2304SS for 450/220 CFM, but think I’m going to spring die the Zephyr ZSI-E30BS for 650/200 CFM. I like the wide range of suction difference. And oddly, the thing that had me spending $500 more was the function that warns you when it’s time to clean the filter. Yup. I’m forgetful. Plus it sounds like the premier brand for basic home use. 

Couldn’t have decided without you all!

—-(original post)—-

I am renovating my kitchen. I have a designer but she does not consult on appliances. I’ve picked my fridge, dishwasher and range, but I’m awash in doubt about a good as I’ve never had a gas stove.

The design calls for a wall mounted, vented range hood. My burners total 5,000 BTU so I know I need 500 CFM or more. I’ve also determined baffle filters are easier to clean than mesh filters. I’ve considered all of this in selecting my five options.

Some are brands available at the main big box stores. Others are only available on Amazon but have been recommended on review websites. Of course, I am a little skeptical of those because I know some of those places get a cut of sales for referrals.

I’m including just brand names and CFM rather than model numbers to keep things simple. They range in price from $350-$700.

Does anyone have experience (good or bad) with any of these brands?

*Kobe 750 CFM
(2 year warrantee)

*Kucht 900 CFM
(4 year warrantee)

*Z Line 500 CFM
(Not sure of warrantee)
(Some reputable sites recommend this brand but most of their products are 400 CFM. I found only one that’s 500 CFM, so I wonder if this brand is better suited foe electric stoves.)

*iKitch 900 CFM
(Only available of Amazon and no brand website of their own, but this was recommended by Bob Villa, which seems like a reputable review source)
(10 year warrantee on motor and 5 year on control panel and lights)

*Ekon 900 CFM
(Same as above regarding no site of their own and Amazon only.)

Closing the grate on the vent didn't help much, so our temporary solution has been to tape over it. Obviously that's not going to work year round, and there's nothing that says ""Guests not wanted"" like a freezing cold bedroom in February with a taped-over hearing vent.

This is the first time I was drilling wood, so far I have drilled on drywall only. I want to know what I did wrong, because it was quite difficult to drill. One of my drill bits broke while trying to drill, and I was wondering if I had hit some sort of metal plate protecting electrical wires.

Here is the drill I use. It's a SKIL.

I continued drilling with the next larger drill bit and completed the job, but even then the pilot holes were a bit shallow, and I had to use considerable force to drive the wood screws in. The screws were about an inch and a half long. Any ideas what I could have done better? Did I use too much force or was I using an incorrect drill bit?",8,6,HomeImprovement,1771

ndrte2,Metal cap on porch railing came off during pressure washing...sticky foam?,"My 1920s house is getting a much-needed repaint in a few weeks by a top local company. The first step was giving the house a bath from top to bottom with pressure washing, including washing the front steps deck and railing. 

It looks like the pressure dislodged this metal end cap, causing it to rise above the wood instead of sitting flat. 

Like so: https://imgur.com/gallery/VGGi3Ts

I can push it down manually with a lot of force, but then it immediately rises back up—almost as though it’s attached with some kind of sticky/squishy foam in the middle. And, as you can see, there is no material around the edges of the cap.

ndrply,Mystery Moisture stain presence in Bedroom Drywall,"Hello all

Very Recently bought a 1950s home. On one of the interior bedroom walls, There is a very strange, horizontal discoloration.  The stain runs in a completely horizontal line, and is about 3 feet long and maybe 2-3 inches tall. There is zero visual signs of any ""dripping"" stains that you might expect of water stains on a wall, due to gravity. Basically, the ""stain"" is too perfectly round, it almost just looks like a stain from furniture up against the wall (but there is moisture readings, more later)-- or slightly wet paint from a touch up job, but the room hasn't been painted for at least 1 month.

**The mystery is that as far as we can tell, there is absolutely no reason for there to be any pipe whatsoever on this wall.** There is no reason all for a water pipe to be present. We know its an old house and who knows what wonky stuff they did back then, but at no point at all in the houses life was this area close to a water source, and there is certainly no reason for water to be running there now. No signs of moisture in the attic either.

**We bought a $35 moisture reader, and it DOES pop at high %. On one end of the stain, it reads around 10%. On the other end, it reads as high as 18% moisture reading.**  Other walls in the same bedroom read around 2.5% tops. IF you go very near the stain but even just a few inches above it reads around 3% max. And the same wall in the other bedroom reads around 2% tops. 

The home DOES have in wall HVAC ducts (not in the floor or ceiling). The vent is on the other side of the wall where there is no moisture readings.

Anybody have any experience with this sort of mystery? Our best bet is the HVAC duct, but its impossible to say, and the duct would be bigger than the stain.

ndro4m,Identifying Sewer Odor,"We have relatively new home (Built 2010) home has a partially finished walkout basement.

Over the past year we have intermittently noticed a sewer / fecal odor primarily in the unfinished / storage portion of the basement. 

We had a plumbing company do a full visual inspection which showed no leaks. They suggested a smoke test if the problem persisted. I have a few questions and would love any feedback. 

Based on my research the problem is (in order of likelihood)

1. Dry P-trap in unused space - this is unlikely as all of our drains are in use and when I have filled with water in the past this has not alleviated the issue.

2. Broken wax seal in toilet - this is a potential issue but relatively unlikely - all of our toilets have been replaced or resealed in the past 5 years. 

3. Issue with the vent stack - I am leaning towards this being the issue. If it is would a smoke test be the best / only way to identify? 

4. Issue with the main sewer line. This is unlikely in my opinion, house is newer, uses PVC line for the main drain and no mature trees on property.

Also, in hindsight I would've 100% hired someone else to do the mudding, this is something that requires finesse and experience, can't just be ""figured out"" so it was extremely frustrating for me. A contractor probably would've done it in a tenth of the time it took me.",13,1,HomeImprovement,817

ndrcxy,Roof interior add insulation question,"I live in a 1 1/2 storey house with the bedrooms on the top floor. The bedroom situation is such that the roof cuts into the room, so you can’t stand full height at that side of the room. From the floor up, it’s knee wall to 4ft height, angled ceiling (~4ft), then flat horizontal ceiling above. 

The insulation in the attic above was upgraded years ago with several inches of batt insulation. At the bottom 1/3 of the roof, the insulation was removed and we had spray insulation installed behind the knee wall. There is no soffit/roof ventilation anymore. 

The problem is at the middle 1/3 of roof section which is less insulated than the other sections and causes ice damming in the winter . As far as I understand, from outside to in, the layers are: shingles, sheathing, 2x8 with fibreglass insulation from 1960s, drywall. How could I go about upgrading this insulation? I would prefer solutions that don’t include taking down either the drywall inside or the roofing on the outside. The shingles have another 10-15 years of life in them and I don’t want to have to replace them quite yet just to get underneath.

I’ve thought about adding a few inches of rigid board insulation inside directly on the existing drywall, and then another layer of drywall. How would that work? Any issues? Do I need a layer of vapor barrier or anything like that?",2,1,HomeImprovement,1351

This goes up and dumps into an open inlet (with s bend) into the sewer line.

Then the part I have an issue with - it will turn on for a half second over and over and over. For what seems like indefinitely.

ndlcu6,Brand new enamel tub is rusting.,"I just installed a brand new enamel steel tub and it's starting to rust.  I think there might be due to micro fractures or scratches because it feels rougher in the base of the tub.  Anyways, is there any way I could clean out the rust and seal it easily so it doesn't rust any more?   Like maybe a wax type product?   I'd really prefer to no need to paint it because I don't trust my painting ability.  [Here's a close up of the rust.](https://imgur.com/a/VtT5Ptf)

Edit:  A couple more facts:

* it was purchased recently but returning it for a warranty isn't an option because it's been tiled in.
* the contractor who installed it removed the supporting styrofoam block so it flexed and theres a belly where water sits.  This may have also resulted in some micro cracks too.
* When my friend was installing the tile, he was wearing boots that had dirt on it and this scratched the enamel a bit.   I believe this is why the bottom feels rougher than the sides.

Edit 2: I emailed the company (Bootz) and this is there response.  It sounds promising!  Here's the email:

>I am sorry about the issue you are having with your newly installed  tub.  A lot of the times during installation, debris gets caught in the  non-skid of the tub.  Once the tub is placed into use, the construction  debris starts to rust.  It looks like the tub is rusting, but it is  actually the debris that is rusting.  We recommend the following  cleaning procedure, as rinsing it out and regular cleaning using don't  do the trick:  
>  
>Get the powdered version of Bar Keeper's Friend (found at Walmart, Lowes or Home Depot)Get the bottom of the tub wet and sprinkle on top to create a pasteLet that sit on the tub for 15-20 minutesAfter that time use a stiff nylon brush to scrub and then rinse out with water.Process may need to be repeated

ndl4bs,Home Remodel- Company or Individually Contract?,"Hey all!
So I recently bought a triplex that, over time, I want to fully renovate. It needs a lot of work, and a lot of updating (bathrooms, kitchens, lighting, flooring, etc).

I’m not sure the best way to go about it. There are several home remodeling companies in my medium-sized city that are locally owned and all seem like good people, and they’ll essentially take care of everything. It seems like most of the work they do is in higher end homes, and I don’t really need that- I just want to modernize it and make it a comfortable place for my tenants. I also don’t want to pay a premium if they’re just going to sub out a bunch of work. 

What do you think is the smartest way to go about it? Hire a company to “take care” or everything or find smaller contractors that specialize in bathrooms, kitchens, flooring, etc. and complete the projects more one-at-a-time? Since it’s an investment property I have to try and keep costs reasonable, but I also don’t have a bunch of free time to try and DIY a bunch of things and want the work done right.

ndl0no,"First time home buyer, how much does it cost to replace a standard tup with a stand up tile shower?","I'm in my due diligence for buying a house, and we discovered that the bathtub has a crack in it, and the seller is making it seem like he doesn't want to pay to fix it (it's a brand new house and tub) so we are going to demand some kind of compensation for the cost to either replace the tub.

Only issue is we are scared that the doorways and bathroom may be too small to maneuver another tub into the bathroom to replace it 1:1, so we figured just bringing in tile and a sliding glass door might do the trick. We just need to know how much we would need to demand back to cover ripping out the existing tub and adding the walk in shower.

ndjj3p,Tile backsplash... mastic OK over plywood?,"So I'm in the process of updating my 50's era kitchen, and am working on putting in a subway tile backsplash.

1. First question: Is it alright to go in with mastic and tile directly over the plywood? Or should I be installing [HardieBacker](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/hardiebacker-ez-grid-cement-board-3-ft-x-5-ft-x-1-4-inch/1000745046) over that segment?

2. Secondary question: there's light contact glue residue over the plywood (it used to be covered with Formica). It was easy to peel off the drywall, but I've had no luck getting it off the plywood. Can I still use mastic directly on it, or will I need to find a way to clean it off?

I live in a house that is over 100 years old (not super common in western Canada) my room is in the basement (living with my parents while finishing up my uni degree.) The ceilings are a little under 6feet tall and for as long as I have lived in this room heating and cooling has been an issue. In the winter at night it is freezing beyond function but when the heat kicks on it heats up fast. Recently my parents got a new furnace with air conditioning. And while it's lovely and I enjoy using the Nest app, I'm finding that when the cold air kicks on it gets very cold (a few degrees colder than what the furnace is set to). The ducts/vents are openings from the ceiling and one is beside my bed. The obnoxious cold air blasting on me is already driving me nuts. 

Is there a kind of adjustable vent/duct cover I could use to stop it from blasting so aggressively?

Looking for a little advice:

We have about 360 sq feet of deck. 20 years old, not well maintained. My two large dogs have finished the job. I finally pulled it apart to replace some boards (and repair a joisted that had split). However, I must have gotten the wrong lumber, because after a few weeks, it shrunk and left large gaps. The repair looks horrible, and lumber prices are through the roof. I’m pretty handy and normally do more research, but admittedly I was winging it. How hard could replacing a few boards be?

The subframe looks good, despite the one beam splitting. We have a few moderately costly projects we need to do, but this has jumped the list because of the botched repairs and our wedding using our backyard next year.

I’m really hesitant to throw a lot of $into this, but it makes sense to replace with trex. It seems like you really have to jump to the top of the line to get much difference in quality of product. We can’t justify that cost or really afford the top of the line, so we were thinking about just getting a the basic. We are in the Midwest. This deck has decent shade and only really concerned about our two par-core expert, large dogs.  Thought being: if there’s not more protection in scratches, it’s really just color choice, we like the cheap colors. That will work.

TLDR: I fucked up and need to replace my deck top. It makes sense to go trex route. But we can’t do transcend, and select seems to be no different from basics. So should we go basics route? 

Questions: who has had BASICS trex. I’ve only seen comments from people with transcend or select. What is your experience with basics? Does it hold up? Fade? Stretch?

Those who have SELECT: why did you go that route (other than color?)  
Do you believe it was worth the cost? At that point, should you just have gone up to transcend or down to basics?

ndex9n,Two switch to One switch in bathroom problem.,"I can’t seem to find my mistake so maybe y’all can help me.

I had two switches in the bathroom. One for a fan. One for a separate light fixture.

Behind the switch cover the switches were wired as such:

Red white black on line
White black on load

The three whites (one for fan, one for light, one for line) were twisted together and capped with a wire nut. These wires were not attached to the switches but shoved in to the back of the box.

The black wires were ran as normal.

The red wire was ran as a jumper between the switches where I assume the white wires would normally get ran.

I purchased a GFCI switch/outlet combo because there were no outlets in bathroom.

I followed the instructions that came with the outlet but something went wonky and I believe it has to do with the red wire. I figured since I wasn’t using two outlets anymore I wouldn’t need to jump but alas I was wrong.

So when I turn on the switch the fan comes on but the light doesn’t. When I turn off the switch my heating and ac lose power (nest thermostat yells at me to let me know I lost power).

I’m pretty positive it has to do with this one red wire that I capped off. So how do I wire in this red one?

My bedroom is exactly 9ft7in L x 11ft7in W but I rounded it to 10x11. I’ve been quoted $950 by a handyman I found on Facebook and $1,200 by a flooring business so far for this. Is this the normal price? I was expecting it to be cheaper - I am not picky with the flooring as long as it is a nice color , I saw a few at Lowe’s that were pretty cheap.

ndevmq,What am I getting myself into? Please help.,"So I have an opportunity of a lifetime, in my eyes anyway. I am taking over a previous hoarder house for next to nothing. A lot of work is involved, but I have the time to do any work, and from the start I know it's a lot of work, like A LOT, but it's a commitment over the next few years to get the house back in tip-top shape.

The details: 

* Built in 1987, 1900 square feet. 4 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms. Bought 25+ years ago for 135k - 1 previous owner, and current assessed value is well above 300k. We have about 70-90k to fix everything up, ideally we'd like to go under that, but we plan on doing a lot of the grunt work ourselves, since we see this as a multi-year long process.

* The house is in ok condition, except for the amount of garbage inside. That itself will take us many months of weekend work to get done. Multiple issues throughout the house I'll expand on down below.

The issues

* Living room - electrical issues on one side of the house, and replacing windows. 

* Kitchen - completely gutting and replacing everything, from cabinets to appliances to flooring. Replacing bay windows facing the backyard. 

* Garage - Garage door needs to be replaced, otherwise everything else in here is fine. Hot water heater is fine. 

* Full bathrooms - completely gutting, replacing bath/shower, toilets, sinks, cabinets, flooring. 

* Half bathroom - completely gutting, replacing toilets, sinks, flooring. 

* The bedrooms - new flooring, some drywall issues. New fixtures in all. 

* The Sunroom - new siding, new flooring, painting.

* Front deck - New planks, painting

Basically we are gutting the entire house, and repainting and putting new flooring down for every room except the hallways since those are good hardwood so we're going to sand / refinish those. Almost need all new windows, and if I remember correctly, would be 13 windows of varying sizes. It's a fuckton of grunt work, and we plan on doing everything except plumping, electrical, and possibly windows. Realistically we know we're in the long haul.

The main question is, where do we start? Are there any good Youtubers / videos I should watch on shit like flooring, cabinets, drywall repair, the whole 9 yards?",18,2,HomeImprovement,2200
ndev6d,Looking for Tips on Drywall Patching,"Hi All, 

I'm looking for some tips on drywall patching. I have two large holes that were created when I removed an L-Bracket left from the previous owner. 

I've attempted the first patch using a drywall mesh repair kit. The issue I'm having is the wire mesh is still visible, and if I add anymore spackling, I feel like there's going to be a bump in the wall. Would it be better to just fill the hole with spackling, then sand down after?  How do people hide the mesh? It just feels like it won't be flush with the wall.

In a 12-page ruling, Judge William Alsup denied a motion to quash a subpoena for the Cabinet secretary’s deposition, writing that “exceptional circumstances” warrant her to sit for one.

The ruling, first reported by Politico, says those circumstances “warrant the deposition of Secretary DeVos for three hours, excluding breaks,” though he acknowledged that it’s “rare” for courts to authorize depositions of Cabinet secretaries.

1. Make all federal student loans interest and fee free.

2. Limit loan offers to the following for which the cost is provided by the school.

	a. Tuition

	b. Room and Board

	c. Meal Plan

3. Student loan payments

	a. Full payment tax is deductible and fully refundable.

	b. Automatic payroll and retirement plan/pension payments deduction of mandatory 10% until loan is satisfied.

	c. Additional payments can be made with after tax money and deducted via the tax return.   

	d. No payments due while unemployed.  

	e. Payments can’t be taken from social security and SSI (disability payments).

	f. Allow employers to contribute towards student loan payments as a fringe benefits as an nontaxable benefit.  

4. Bankruptcy treatment

	a. No changes from the current law.  

5. Refinance

	a. Loans would need to be refinanced into this plan. Private loans and Federal loans can be re-financed into this plan.  

Reasoning for the possible critiques of the plan above.  

1. Why should Student loans be interest free? They should pay interest like everyone else. Why should they get a tax deduction on the full payments.  

 We need an incentive for people to participate in the plan. This plan forces tax payer to carry the burden of the interest rate and the tax deductions.  At the currently mentioned $1.5 Trillion and assuming an APR of 2.2% and only the mandatory 10% payroll deduction would be $370.1 billion while resulting in $308.43 billion in payments. This could payoff the original principle within 5 years. I acknowledge that these calculations are simplistic and that a department like the CBO would have more refined cost and benefit analysis. But, this would be a much easier pill to swallow than loan forgiveness. My hope would be that after the loans are at a more manageable level that it would kept to properly fund a abysmally funded k-12 and public college education system. That would reduce the need for future students to take out student loans. Thoughts, concerns, suggestions?  

Calculations

Total cost = principle \* interest rate + median household income \* 10% \* typical federal effective tax rate \* number of people with student loans.

Total cost = $1.5 Trillion \* .022 + $69k \*.10 \* .13 \* 44.7 million

Total cost = $330 billion + $40.1 billion

Total cost = $370.1 billion on the first year.",18,1,StudentLoans,2385

nghk78,Path Forward,"TL;DR: My story about student loans, how they suck, and don’t wish them on anyone. 

This post is going to be a rant/relief for me so appreciate you reading it.

My husband and I have $46K in student loan debt between the two of us. This was originally higher. When we met in 2010:

* Husband had a $12K private student loan with a 9.25% interest rate that he hadn't made that much of a dent on when we met.
* Husband had another 2x Department of Education loans equating to $20K with a 6.625% interest rate.
* I have 2x Department of Education loans that started their payment cycle in 2012 that equated to a little over $45K with a 6.875% interest rate. 

This is **$77K**. We have been able to not even get to half of it paid off since we have been together. We don't qualify for any forgiveness (though my husband can qualify for the public service forgiveness in 3 years) and we're not holding out any hope for Biden or congress to do anything.

We have been taking advantage of the COVID forbearance and throwing money at the principal for the Dept of ED loans. We wiped out the remaining balance of the private student loan (about $11K) since that was still collecting interest at the beginning of May. We were able to do that because we have been building a really healthy savings account and decided to wipe it.

We have been itching to buy a house. We finally decided as to where at the beginning of the month (after months of wavering on a location) so we started seriously exploring. We knew our budget and knew what we could put as a down payment, provide us with a financial cushion, and make the required student loan payments. We found a place that we **loved** and were about to make an offer until we ran the numbers and realized that it wasn't going to make sense to do it. We were actually going to take advantage of our state's SmartBuy program for first-time homebuyers to wipe out $30K of our student loan debt (free money, right?). Well, once we did the math, it was going to cost us more per month to utilize the state's plan because they were requiring a higher interest rate to wipe the student loans as opposed to getting a conventional mortgage with a lower interest rate. We backed out of the deal and never made an offer because we knew that while we could pay the mortgage every month, we would have to decrease our contribution to investments, retirements, savings, etc, but still need to pay almost $500/month in student loans. So we backed out.

*NOTE: You're might be wondering how we couldn't afford another $500/month on the mortgage and NOT cut into investment and retirement accounts contributions? The place we were looking at was a condo with a $438/month HOA. THAT was the problem. If the HOA wasn't there, we would have been fine.*

We were devasted. The one place we looked at was in the area that we wanted and we knew we couldn't take the risk because what we realized was that our student loans were what was in the way. If we didn't have the student loan payment, we would be able to afford the place we were looking at and be perfectly fine.

What you don't realize is that as you pay on your student loans monthly, they are always just there in the background but so long as you're paying and are able to budget for it while still being able to live, they're not really a nuance -- just annoying. But when you want to do something big, like buy a permanent home, they are **right there** and smack you in the face **hard**.

We have been working with a financial advisor since the beginning of the year and he's been able to invest in some of the money and we have seen some returns but not much (slow growth). I reached out to him to explain what we ran into and asked for his advice. He, honestly, told me to clear the account with him because though we didn't have much with him and until we pay off the student loans, this was going to be a recurring issue. So take advantage of the no-interest now, pay down what you can, and come back in 12-18 months when the stock market goes through its cycle of ups and downs. I really appreciated his honesty. While we want a healthy investment as another way to fund our future retirement, we can't have the future we want if we can't get rid of the student loans that we have had haunting us both for over a decade.

After this advice, we have decided to:

* Wipe our investment account, which is only $20K put it towards my 2x student loans while it's in forbearance since it has the higher interest rate and higher monthly payment;
* Take the monthly recurring deposits we were putting into the investment account and direct them to student loans (another $1K per month);
* At the end of September, evaluate how much extra we want to put towards my husband's loan from savings (since he got $11K to pay off the private in May, he'll still get some large payment -- just not $20K);
* Still contribute the same amounts that we have to retirement and savings

Our original plan over 6 months (starting from April 2021 to September 2021) was to have an aggressive goal of getting the loans down to $30K; this will get us under $20K in total. At the end of September, when interest rates will probably come back, we'll evaluate how much to contribute monthly to payments (probably keep it at the $1K or increase it slightly to offset the accrued interest).

While I hate that I have to wipe my investment account after not even 5 months, I feel a sense of relief knowing while I could keep it and continue to see gains and losses from investments, my husband and I will never be able to get a permanent home and build equity if we have these damn student loans constantly following us.

So while we won't have all of them paid off during the forbearance, at least it's a step in the right direction. I **hope** that by my husband's next birthday (April 24th), we will have all, if not, almost all of the student loans paid off while continuing to have a healthy savings account, and be in a much better situation to look for our future home.

I have never had so much anxiety about buying a house as I have over the past 3 weeks and then coming to the realization that we simply cannot afford it. While I know there are folks out there that will buy houses with bad credit, have much higher monthly payments, and much more debt, I never want to put myself or my husband in that situation to not be able to pay our student loans and/or mortgage. If we can't do either, then we clearly did not prepare well enough.

This whole house buying exercise really put things into perspective of how much student loans are such a drain on students that want to better themselves to receive an education in something they are passionate about and contribute to society with this newly obtained knowledge and skillset. I want everyone to be able to receive the same education my husband and I have been fortunate enough to receive and not drown in debt that follows them for decades. It really shows how our education system is severely overpriced with little ROI. 

I hope that congress does something for those drowning in debt. It will help stimulate our economy significantly, especially as we dig ourselves out of the downward spiral caused by COVID.

To those that stuck this far to read this, thank you. I really need to write this out - it was cathartic. I hope those that are struggling to handle these awful payments find relief soon. No one should be faced with such a large price tag to receive an education.",13,5,StudentLoans,7501
ngfnqz,Does unpaid interest capitalize on federal loans on 09/30/2021?," I just get off the phone with my service provider and they are telling me that any interest I had accrued previous to the forbearance period will be capitalized.

As an example If I had a loan with a principal amount of $5000 @ 6.8% interest and had accrued $700 worth of interest, after 09/30/2021, I'll be paying 6.8% interest on $5700, not on the original $5000.

My partner (M now 37) was born into a low income family. He was the oldest of 7 kids through multiple divorces/ remarriages. He was always a quiet reader type and in high school got accepted to a prestigious engineering university (40k+ a year at the time). His parents and the University convinced him to just sign up for all the loans saying they would help, he was young and he and his parents didn't really know any better so he signed all the paperwork. He was doing good at school (biomedical engineering degree) until junior year his mom had a mental breakdown and showed up at his college dorm in her nightgown at 3am and had to be admitted to a psychiatric unit for multiple months for various conditions. His step father was mia so he had to drop out and go home to care for his 4 dependant younger siblings at the time (the 4 younger ones were all under 10 years of age, of the older ones 1 was out of state, the other was a step brother and not of age). The University had no policy for this kind of situation and considered him still enrolled. By the time his mother was able to come back to care for his siblings he was failing all of his classes and the University had kicked him out. Since then he has been saddled with over $120,000 worth of college debt + years of interest and negative credit score, no degree to show for it and any job he gets now debt collectors collect almost all of his paychecks.

nfvvmh,20 Year Loan Refinance | Buy BTC w/ Extra Cash Flow,"Currently I have a 10 year loan with about $100k outstanding. I am about a year in and am considering refinancing to a 20 year loan to lower my monthly payments from 1.1k to 600ish. I'd then plan to invest 200 a month into BTC for a 20 year long HODL. I can make interest by lending out my BTC for periods at a time for addition wealth creation (currently have .2 btc).

Am I crazy?

$100K in 20 years will just mean nothing. If the dollar loses on average 2% a year through inflation - the next years are going to be significant higher. $100K will be worth nothing.

BTC on the other hand has the stored value and could even grow in time. Once we don't think about BTC in terms of dollars, you'll know we're there.

I know it is risky but I'm sick of having to work for money that is constantly loosing value to pay for an overpriced education.

Edit: someone pointed out I should highlight my reasons for liking case over rpi. It mainly boils down to campus culture and surroundings. Troy NY vs Cleveland is a no contest for me, and case being in the middle of university circle is really appealing to me .  Case western has a one door policy, meaning if I ever find engineering being the wrong choice for me, I will have a very easy time switching majors.

I'm graduating from medical school in a week. I have 290k personally in student loans, with interest rates varying from 3.4-7.6%. I had planned to do a REPAYE loan payment program, using my 2020 W2 to apply, giving me a payment of $0/month until I have to update my income. I will be working at a PSLF-qualifying hospital and my interests in medicine will keep me at such an institution in the future.

Yesterday, my mother let me know that I'll also be paying on my Parent PLUS loans, as she isn't able to cover them. There is about $65k in her name. I've learned that Parent PLUS loans can't be transferred into my name without refinancing to a private loan, thus making the loan no longer forgivable through a PSLF.

Mom is also eligible for PSLF through her job and will be for at least a decade as well, so I'm planning on setting her PLUS loans on an income-driven plan and paying on those simultaneously.

Given my interest in doing a PSLF, does it make the most sense to keep the Parent PLUS loans in her name and to pay the minimum payment on both sets of loans (mine and hers) for the next 10 years? I'd like to put as little money into them as possible, both monthly and in the long-term.

So here’s my question, and I’m going to use an example to clarify.

Say I have a total balance of $60,000 and owe $800 a month total, covering 8 loan groups.

The monthly payment for each group is $100.

Here’s the question: If I pay off Group A, will my monthly payment become $700 a month, or will Nelnet still charge $800 a month and just allocate the $100 that’s been going toward Group A to all the other groups?

I’m hoping paying off one or two of the loans will lower my overall monthly payment when the deferral ends, but I read somewhere that your monthly payment stays the same until everything is paid off, even if you pay off one or more of the individual groups.

Our other private loan is down to $26k.  

I have another $74k in Federal. My husband has another $45k in Federal. We are just going to make the minimum payments and pay the tax bomb at the end.. Unless things change for us financially.

I'm incredibly proud of us for paying as much off as we have. We are very fortunate, I know. More than others. But it's still defeating.  Every month we are watching our expenses and putting so many things aside because we want the private student loans gone, including starting a family.

We aren't hitting the Federal loans because some type of forgiveness is coming and I want to take advantage of it. Even if it's ""only"" $10k per loan. Literally anything.

I'm so angry neither of us had any real guidance on choosing schools.  I paid over $100k for a $30-$50k degree. He paid $70k for a $30-$50k degree. I know it is what it is, but it just sucks.

ndfjvo,Help Understanding Federal Loans?,"): Hello, I'm very confused on taking out loans still... I'm a rising junior but just transferred college for my major (trying to get better job prospects) and am being forced to start out as a freshman. I don't feel like I understand the amount of debt I'll be in when I graduate. Here's everything:

Major: Industrial Design

Class status: Freshman with sophomore standing (so 2nd year aid level for fed loans)

Current loans out: 11k in federal loans

Price of college/yr: \~13k

It'll take me 4 years to graduate now. A relative said they will 100% pay for my first two years at my new school, which I am insanely grateful for. Additionally, I am planning to get a job on campus, and appeal my aid by 4k (max) each year.

I think my total debt would be: (13 x 2 ) + 11 = 48k.

Is that correct? Is there something I'm missing? If I start out as a freshman in my class standing, will be 11k in fed loans go up each year? As such, will the 11 in my total debt calculation be different? Do I ever hit the max on those loans? ):

I'm sorry I don't understand anything. I'm a first gen college student with parents who do not wish to really help me at all. I made my college change for better job prospects, but I'm worried my debt will be too much, especially if I calculated my federal sub/unsub loans wrong.",2,3,StudentLoans,1308
ndg8da,Tuition went to collections and appeal was denied even though my father was hospitalized and grandfather died of covid during last spring semester,Serious question: I’ve been working on credit for quite awhile and finally had over 700 and wa steady to refinance my cap one loan. Last spring when covid closed the world down I was enrolled in 4 classes with the local community college. I had FA which I was told would cover the cost. I was hospitalized with covid and my grandfather passed in March and may time frame. Needless to say I didn’t finish class. I also never technically withdrew since I thought it would be automatic and I spoke to the school in Augusta September timeframe and they told me to file an appeal when possible and it would forgive the $1590 they say I owed. I received a collection letter in January and wrote a letter to st Pete college and said that wasn’t my debt. A lady called me and I again explained the situation. She told me to file Appeal when I could so that I could register for spring semester 2021. I filed the appeal in March and submitted documents from hospital and my grandfather obituary (he passed of covid) and my appeal was instantly (the next day) denied because they said it was too difficult to pull up last years records and basically an accounting nightmare. I replied and asked to speak to dean. They continued to email me back once every 4 weeks to tell me yes it is indeed denied because I could only file an appeal with 60 days of end of semester. This wouldn’t have been possible as I was as caring for my dad and grandmother plus the previous lady told me not to worry and just do it before I enrolled again. Now I see that wyndam collections has put a $1600 bill on my credit reports resulting in 30 point loss. I also received a letter from Navient that my student loans were forgiven for last spring semester. So really I shouldn’t owe them anything at all. Death and covid hospitalization with evidence should be adequate grounds for appeal but they keep saying no and just response from business office or “accounting specialist” and won’t allow me to speak to dean. I feel helpless and that all my hard work has gone to waste. I can’t afford to pay for an entire semester of school that I didn’t attend. I was only able to go to school because of financial aid and which was valid and should’ve covered the tuition. I feel like I’m being deceived and don’t know what to do.

ndaqnt,Is it possible to pay back 93k or 110k of loans with this expected salary?,"So I'm thinking about either going to the College for Creative Studies or DAAP to pursue a bachelors in Industrial/Product design.

 I've already gotten as much as I can in scholarships and grants from CCS, I even negotiated an extra 7k a year in aid. I do have a pell grant Despite that, it's still going to cost me 93k by the time I graduate: 27,500 in federal loans and 62,500 in private loans.

The other school I got accepted into, DAAP, has the best ID program in the U.S. and it comes with 5 semesters of co-op built into the curriculum, and has tons of industry connections. It's definitely my dream school... but it also costs 110k. That's as low as I can get it from them.

The ID industry is super competitive, which is why I'd like to go to DAAP. The alumni network and having up to 5 internships before I even graduate would give me a huge edge over students from other schools who probably only had 1 or 2 if any.

Is the idea of being able to pay off the loans from either of these schools just a pipe dream or can it be done- how?

 And what's my life going to look like with that much debt? My parents don't have the money to help me pay off my loans so it's going to be all up to me.

nda4e3,Co-signer wants to be released from student loan and i'm drowning in debt due to medical leave from school. I have no clue what to do.,"Tldr: I took a year off of school to focus on my mental health and now I have no deferment period on my student loans despite JUST graduating.  I do not have a job, and loan providers will not give me COVID relief forbearance or hardship forbearance and I cannot afford my payments, my co-signer wants to be released, and I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  

I have three student loan providers. 1 through Sallie Mae, 1 through Discover Student Loans, and my federal loans are all combined in one payment. Federal loans are temporarily suspended due to the president's executive order however I am still expected to make full payments with Sallie Mae ($225 p/month) and Discover ($175 p/month).

When I was a senior in college I wound up taking a leave of absence to focus on my mental health. During those times I wasn't a full-time student and my student loan providers said I used up all of my deferment periods and I had to start paying back my loans in full. I informed them that I was not able to work at the time and I didn't know what to do because I didn't want to fall delinquent on my loans. They said my only option was to go back to school full time (which I wasn't ready to do yet) in order to stop payments. 

I went back to school part-time in Fall 2019 and used a hardship forbearance for the semester on my two private loans, I worked full time to pay for housing and make payments on my federal loans. I went back to school full time in Spring 2020 and my payments were stopped.  I had to take two more classes the following semester (Fall 2020) to graduate and that is considered part-time status so I went back into repayment however because of COVID I was given three months of pandemic relief forbearance from August-November 2020. I went back to work in August 2020 but was only given part-time hours. I never received UI and in Feb 2021 I could no longer afford to make payments on my loans AND pay my rent so I had to move back in with my mother however I lost accessibility to my job and had to quit that too. I'm still unemployed at this time and seeking full-time work, but nothing yet sadly. 

My two private loans are co-signed by my godmother/aunt (father's side) however I've been disowned by that side of my family and she no longer wants anything to do with me or my student loans and has been harassing me to release her as a cosigner. I am not able to release her though for a number of reasons like using a hardship forbearance during Fall 2019 and still not having a job. 

I don't know what else to do or who to ask for help. I am now 2 months delinquent on my Discover student loan and my godmother is really angry because it's affecting her credit score and she's trying to buy a home. Even though she is the co-signer she will not make payments and has made it clear that I need to take care of this. I don't really even know how to google help for this stuff and I have so many other financial obligations that I also cannot pay and I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction because I feel like I'm drowing.",70,66,StudentLoans,3055

I've been on REPAYE for 6 years now and have had a very low payment - I read that if I got married it would change and be a higher pay rate.

I called my student loan servicer and asked if I got married on the REPAYE plan, if my spouse's income would be counted as my income, (thus increasing my payment, which would leave us in a very bad place - you can see why this is an important question). I also asked what plan I should move to if I want to keep my payment the same while married. She told me she has never in her life heard of any repayment plan using spousal income to calculate payment, regardless of filing separately or jointly - so go ahead and get married and my payment will only use my income.

I kind of call bs on this because of all the research I have done but it's literally her job to know this and those were the words of my own loan servicer. I asked her twice and she reassured me that my loan payment would not change if I got married.

I sent a follow up email to get it in writing and to get another answer and am awaiting a reply. I really don't think she gave me the correct answer and it was more of a question of - which plan can I switch to so I can use my own income instead of both incomes.

My wife (and me) are feeling pretty frustrated and confused. She currently owes about $62k in student loans (BA and MA). They are all Stafford Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) and serviced by CFI (College Foundation, Inc). She never consolidated. Her loans didn't qualify for the CARES act because ""Loans serviced by College Foundation, Inc. are neither Direct Loans nor owned by the federal government and were not included in the CARES Act"" which was ok because we were fortunate in that we didn't experience a drop in income throughout the pandemic. Thing is we don't really understand why her loans didn't qualify - they are Stafford loans! Can anyone explain this to me like I'm 5 (or like an 18 year old college freshman about to sign their life away)? 

Also she’s worked in non-profits for 8 years. Her understanding is that, because her loans somehow aren't direct loans, they will not qualify for PSLF?

Finally, we recently turned a decent profit on our house that we just sold. We have the opportunity to pay off her student loans or to put a chunk of change towards our new mortgage, significantly reducing the monthly payment. To us, it makes sense to take care of the student loans because the interest rate is far higher than our mortgage's interest rate, but if she MIGHT qualify for forgiveness soon, or if the government might be forgiving some loans soon, maybe that's not the best option? Whenever she tries to talk to anyone at CFI, it's super unhelpful and they can never seem to give her a direct answer on anything so I'm grateful for any info you all might have!

All of the money he earns goes toward our bills and necessities. I’ve always known loans would be my only way of completing this, but I’m not sure if it’s the right choice anymore. The tuition itself isn’t so bad. A little over $18,000 for the whole thing (compared to $50,000 for the only other dental hygiene program in my area). It’s other costs that really start adding up. It’s about $7,000 for supplies such as books and uniforms. A little over $2,000 for boards to be licensed. They also require health insurance, which I don’t have and through the school for a year it was just under $4,000 and I’d need two years worth. I’m already struggling to find the money for random costs they have (enrollment fee of $200, parking fee of $100, application fee of $75). That may not seem like much to some but as i said all of our money goes to bills and necessities with nothing left over, honestly we barely have enough for that. So trying to total all of this up seems like it’s way more than I was hoping. I had a backup plan for a dental assisting program in case I wasn’t accepted. Sure it wouldn’t pay nearly as much, but it’d leave me completely debt free (right under $6000 for everything, tuition and supplies). I was thinking maybe I could pursue the dental assisting and save up to be more prepared and maybe even land a job somewhere where they’d be willing to help pay some of the costs.

I realize that this probably seems like a waste of money to most of you, but choosing the right payoff strategy (refinancing and paying minimums vs. aggressive payoff vs. IDR until forgiveness) could potentially save me $100,000 in today's dollars. At worst, the planner tells me I've already come up with the best plan and I can stop tying myself in knots wondering if I'm leaving money on the table with my payoff strategy, and I would consider that well worth the $500 consultation. At best, I save 6 figures over the life of these loans.

My situation is an interesting one. I have a private student loan taken out through a local credit union (Graduated Fall of 2017, started paying off in Summer of 2018), and from my understanding these loans are supposed to be shown as installment payments on my credit report (I have another student loan through Discover that is displayed correctly). However, this specific student loan in mention is showing up as a revolving credit account, and because of that it is associated with a credit utilization percentage (it is showing 95% credit utilization from all three bureau's, and it is really affecting my score with it being that high). Is this a normal thing for student loans? If not, how do I go about fixing it to show it as an installment payment? I tried calling the accounting service of the loan provider but they weren't very helpful.. I have full proof that this is a private student loan as well.

nbp4wf,Is $60K in Student Loans a lot?,"So I am an American that studied International Relations at a university in the UK and graduated in mid-2020. I hoped to work in London after my undergrad degree, but visa restrictions and COVID left me with no choice to return to the United States in October. I haven't found much luck landing a job here since I've back. I have landed an internship in Washington DC for the summer for a consulting firm that works with telecom companies. I have an offer to do an MSc in ""International Politics"" at a university in London this Fall. I would have to pull out about $60k in students loans ($20,500 in Direct Unsub and $39,500 in Grad Plus). Since leaving the UK, the visa rules have changed and now I can stay in the UK for 2 years without a company sponsor. Before 2021, you were only granted 6 months to find a company to sponsor your next visa. Even now, many of the jobs I wanted to apply for in my undergrad are now open for me to apply as they do not have to sponsor me right after my studies. I just can't apply for them yet as I need to be in the UK when applying for these positions. I do feel like $60k in student loans is a lot, but the opportunity to complete my master's degree in one year is appealing and I am in a location that offers a lot of opportunities in my chosen career field. With the money I have saved from my summer internship, a small amount of savings from a previous job, and I plan to work alongside my studies, I feel like I can handle this amount of debt. Granted, I will be living in London which is super expensive and who knows what the job market will be like in 2022/23. Furthermore, I have spoken to a number of individuals in my chosen career field and they almost all agree that a master's degree is well worth it despite the immediate financial burden. 

A few details about me: I am 23 years old and I am really interested in working in management consultancy and then eventually working for an international organisation like NATO or the UNFCCC. Many of the positions within these organisations require a master's degree before applying which is also why I am seeking to continue my studies. Also, with my student visa, I can work a total of 20 hours a week max during term-time. I have some experience working during my studies already as I did an internship during my final year of undergrad where I worked 2 days a week at a nearby company. I wanted to continue working for them, but they were not licensed to sponsor work visas.

Me: All Federal Loans on IBR. I work part-time as an associate in addition to starting my own business (S-Corps) that is just now making some money so I can pay myself.

I've been in contact with my college about this.

Basically, I'm (21, m) living with my friend at the moment because I can't afford rent or a house. I lived in a house with my family this time last year, but they couldn't afford to make payments and the house was foreclosed. They had to live with my uncle, and their house wasn't big enough for the three of us so my friend let me stay with her. I provided documentation that my house was foreclosed, but one of the counselors told me they probably won't qualify that as homelessness.

I don't stay at a shelter because I have a friend who is letting me live with her, but it seems like that may be the only documentation they take. Is there any way around this? One counselor mentioned something like a dependency override? But I'm not sure if that would apply to me.

I don't know what to do. I file my taxes independently, I pay for all of my own expenses (phone bill, etc), but I won't be able to afford my final year of college because of this, unless I am able to attain independency to the FAFSA.

Should I try and get paperwork from a homeless shelter proving it? Is there another option I can take?

Thanks, and sorry for the long post.

 P.S.: I found this section on independency on the FAFSA website and it definitely applies to me. Any way I can use this?

nacupw,Student Loan / Financial Advice,"Mobile user! 

Not sure if this is the place to post (i’m also posting in r/creditcards) but figured I’d ask for advice here as well since I want advice on credit! Anything would be appreciated!

I’m a 22 year old college student in America. I’m out of school at the moment with about $10k left in student loans. My father was diagnosed with leukemia and my mother had massive heart failure in the same week of my junior year in college so I had to leave school to take care of them and had to pick up a full time job to help pay on bills like my car insurance (my car is paid off), student loans, food, phone (which they were helping me pay on before hand) and help them pay on their own bills since I am living with them again. 

I was ready to return to school and then covid hit and everything shut down. Classes have since reopened but I’m not sure what to do. I still have the credits from all my classes but I’ve been looking at going to a local community college to get a degree or an assistance program that my state offers. I’ve never been great at school and I’m worried that with my full time job i wouldn’t be able to devote myself to my classes fully OR if I quit my job to go back to school then the money I have saved will eventually run out and I wouldn’t be able to help my parents (as they have become dependent on my financial support every month) or pay for my own needs. On top of this, I’m currently looking for a new (preferably higher paying) job so I can leave my current one that i’ve been at for about 2.5 years. 

A big obstacle for me as of this moment is waiting to see if the government does any sort of student debt relief. I got my stimulus money back when I filed taxes and I actually got some money back from the state. Since the student loans don’t have interest on them right now I know the smart thing to do would be to put what money i can from income and the stimulus/tax return into savings and let it build interest so if the government doesn’t relieve any student debt then i can just pay it off. 

My girlfriend has lead me to come and ask on this sub and I see how she didn’t go to college but her mother is very smart and has earned her a lot of money in the stock market (invested $5k and currently has $13k worth of stocks) and she doesn’t have any student loans as she hasn’t attended college (she’s 21) and she’s a manager of a sport health facility making ~$30k a year and she’s already looking at buying a house, she just bought a tesla and uses a credit card to buy everything and had a 700 FICO score and is building credit. Im currently making ~$25k a year as a shift leader in the same sport health facility with a 680 FICO. I don’t have a credit card because my parents always shunned them since they had over $40k in credit card debt but i see my sister (35) and girlfriend use them for everyday purposes. 

I have no idea what kind of card would be good for me or banks that accept people in my situation. I know it can be a very useful tool to help build credit if you pay it off instantly. I have been playing with the idea of opening a Roth ira since I am thinking about my future but I don’t know much about any of this sort of stuff

I know a lot of this was personal and may not belong on this page but I really would like some opinions or advice whether someone has been in this exact situation or just has some insight on good decisions i should make. thank you for your time.",2,0,StudentLoans,3444

Husband got into medical school in Australia in 2020 but we are having a nightmare of a time trying to get financial aid. We are U.S citizens. Here's the catch, this particular school doesn't take Federal loans. It wouldn't be enough anyway at only 20k U.S.D a year and school is 30k a year. The only lender is Sallie Mae who requires U.S citizen to co-sign. I co-signed it because my credit score is 825/850 so it's pretty damn good but I only make 40k. His was credit score was 690 and had been employed with current job for 5 months with 65k earnings with solid work history. The loan was denied for 75k which is a year of medical school and 15k to move internationally and cover 6 months of expenses so we can get settled. We don't have collateral like a house. At the time, I had 25k in IRA and 6k in savings (I hold our savings because I'm better with money). No CD accounts and only had been employed with current job for 4 months but solid job history. Since he doesn't have anyone in his family without overextended credit/bad credit, he had to defer medical school for a year because we couldn't get loan. 

Nearly a year later, I have 30k saved and 27k in IRA, low debt to income ratio, 820 credit score, 14 months at current job. His credit score is now 770 with 15 months of 65k job.

I am a first-gen college student and will be graduating next year with my B.S. in Economics and Political Science (emphases in International Politics/Globalization, minor in Global Citizenship and certificate in International Relations) with no debt/student loans. I have paid for my tuition through scholarships, grants, and by working four part-time jobs. I also have about $14k in a college fund that my mom and grandma left for me (that I haven't had to touch), and I have about $12k in savings.

**My question is:** should I get my M.S. in International Affairs and Global Enterprise that would take two years and would cost $22k+ by paying for it with my college fund/savings (it is possible I could get a graduate assistant position that would cover full tuition) and run the risk of needing to take out student loans? Or should I keep my money and get a job (and possibly use that money toward buying a house)?

(Note: my mom and grandma have passed away and I am on my own now (since 2018), so doing my master's would mean I would be living very poorly for an additional two years.)",11,3,StudentLoans,1100
n8vhnc,deferring PLUS loans while doing masters abroad?,"Simple question but can't seem to find an easy answer for this.  Is it possible to defer your undergrad PLUS loans while pursuing a full-time masters abroad?

n8trkl,Advice for convincing parents to hold off on paying the parent plus loans until September? I am expected to pay them back.,"A bit of background: 

1. My parents took PP Loans out that I had agreed to pay back - the total amount right now, excluding interest, is $33k
2. I have held up my end of the deal and made every payment for the past 5 years, except during this forbearance period
3. My parents retired in 2020, just closed on selling their house, and made enough to pay off all of their debts - this PP Loan included (switching to full time RV’ers)
4. My dad is the one that relays this info, and is notoriously stubborn. Especially if finances are involved.

To my surprise, they have decided they want to pay off all of the $33k in loans, and are expecting me to pay them back in one of these 2 ways:
1. Pay them a fixed rate of $350/month for the next 4.5 years (totals out to $18k that I pay, and they’d absorb the remaining $15k)
2. I give them a lump sum of $13k now, and they absorb the remaining $20k - this is both our preferred option.

I have been saving up with the intention to pay a lump sum on those loans right before the forbearance ends, assuming Biden doesn’t come through and forgive some of those loans. I briefly tried to convince my dad to hold off until then, because there’s a (very small) chance we see some of that loan forgiven and both he and I end up paying less. In his mind, that’s not going to happen (called it a ‘pipe dream’), and raised a fuss at the mere thought of waiting just a few more months. They are financially fine and are not planning on buying anything new in the near future, so having this debt there for a couple more months really isn’t hurting them especially given the funds to pay it off are just a click away. Seemingly the only reason he won’t agree is because he’s impatient and just wants to clear his name of debt. I get that, but they have an insanely high credit score and have always been great at paying off debt, so it’s not like this has been a lifelong ‘issue’ of theirs and they’re finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. 

He didn’t give me the chance to explain that by paying him the 13k upfront, I’m putting myself in a position of only having maybe 1 month of emergency expenses available. In his mind though, this is ‘doing the responsible thing, and stepping out of my ‘comfort zone’ to do what needs to be done’. I work in entertainment, where layoffs aren’t uncommon and turnover is high, so by waiting until the end of August, it allows me to build a larger safety net whilst giving us both time to wait and see what the outcome of any potential forgiveness may be. 

How do I convince them to wait? Without getting political here, is there any Republican Financial Advisor advice or sites I can share with them when I inevitably draft an email explaining my situation? I specify Republican because politics is inherently part of my request to wait, and any time I mention Biden, it never goes well… they’re Trump supporters. 

Any and all advice is recommended 

TLDR; My parents are paying off the PP Loans (33k) that I agreed to pay before I went to college in 2010. They’re also agreeing to absorb a portion of that 33k, leaving me to either pay them a smaller lump sum upfront (13k), or a fixed rate totaling a higher sum (18k) over 4.5 years. They have great credit and no other debt, with no intention of buying anything big/new in the near future, but are eager to pay them NOW to clear their name of debt as they’ve just sold their house and have the means to do so. They don’t believe forgiveness will happen and don’t want to wait. I won’t be in a position to accept the better option (upfront 13k) until August, and I do not want anymore monthly payments, so the 18k option is not really an option in my mind. How can I convince them to wait, and that the money sitting in the bank for 3-4 more months is essentially the same as having them paid off?",7,4,StudentLoans,3834
n8tlau,Making a SAP Appeal for the Third time. Scared that this third appeal won't get accepted.,"I'm 20 years old, I'm currently in community college and I'm currently going through the semester. I'm not doing well all my classes as I am behind in all of them and at the same time, I've also been dealing with depression and anxiety that it's been really hard for me to focus in class, or even find motivation to get assignments done. I've been contemplating dropping all my classes because I have a gut feeling I won't get higher than a D in my classes and I don't want my grades to further drop my GPA, but I'm scared that if I drop all my classes and then make a SAP appeal, it won't be a good look for me. My GPA currently stands at 0.735.

I've made two appeals prior to this one that I will have to make because regardless of what happens, I won't have a 2.0 GPA which is required to continue receiving financial aid. I have been feeling really anxious about whether or not my appeal will be accepted because I've already made two appeals. The first one was just me simply wanting to come back and better myself for college, the second appeal was because I ended up getting all D's in my semester and I dropped my Winter classes because my Dad passed away towards the end of the semester and I decided to drop my two Winter classes. Those two appeals got accepted, but with this third appeal, I've been having so much anxiety thinking that this appeal won't be accepted because I feel that  I haven't made any progress after the first two appeals made.

Personally, I want to just drop all my classes, focus on my mental health and come back, learning from my previous mistakes so I can have a clear mindset going into the Fall semester, but I'm scared that if I drop all my classes, it's not going to look good when I make that SAP appeal. I don't know what to do. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.",4,1,StudentLoans,1822
n8t2i0,I'm(21/M) new to student loans and have some questions,"So, for the last 3 years I've been paying for Community College out of pocket as a CS/Mathematics double major, while living at home and working about 30 hours a week.

n8pzwj,My disabled/retired dad is still paying off 30yo med school loans,"My dad worked as a psychiatrist for the VA. He lost his job around 2006 and eventually qualified retroactively for disability for previously undiagnosed ADD. I found out today that he’s still paying off student loans—he consolidated his med school debt with debt from my undergrad, which he was also paying for part of. He graduated from med school in 1986. He says that because of his ADD, he’s been incapable of navigating any process to find out if he can stop paying the loans. I’d like to try to help him, mostly because it frustrates me that he’s throwing $300 a month at this and still has \~$17K left.

He’s not working now and he consolidated the loans. He also worked in the public sector and is disabled. I don’t really have more detail yet beyond what I’ve written, but I could follow up with him to get more information. In my admittedly brief research, what I found made it sound like since he consolidated the loans, anything he's done in the past wouldn't matter, and he either wouldn't qualify for forgiveness because he's not still working, or he'd have to re-structure the loans and the clock on 10 years of timely payments would only start now.

Now I’m doing better. I got treatment for the depression. Discovered I had ADHD and got treatment in the last year.

Fortunately or unfortunately during the pandemic, they didn't halt payments...so I've been trying to kill it off ever since.

As a long time lurker (sans account), I've always loved the posts that provide deep dives into how loans are paid off, what sort of lifestyles people were living, and of course data to prove it.

So here it is...

**How I got the loans...**

* I graduated in 2013 with a bachelors degree from an out of state public school.
* In 2016, I graduated with a masters degree from an out of state public school (which I mostly got a full ride for).

**How I paid off the loans**

[Here's a Google Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQbroZhjrd_-HHQq_40ugmZcFRvmE1XYiukWEkt-O3-X75kw1mjsBzzc7rGkPaRUuhZhVDY_VdWN3SI/pubhtml?gid=2092141458&single=true) of how I paid them off over time. (Will amend this post to embed the chart, just so that no one thinks that the link is phishing or worse, a rickroll. Edit: ok. embedding doesn't work here, sorry.) 

**Factors that went into making those payments...**

*Making a deal w/ the devil - selecting a low interest rate in exchange for high monthly payments*

* I started out of school doing consulting work initially, which earned around $70k a year. Living in a larger city in the US and in an apartment (alone) was costly and meant I had to budget EVERYTHING. Still, I refinanced my loans under Sallie Mae to Citizens Bank in December 2016. They gave me a super sweet low fixed rate (at the time) of 3.99%. But the drawback that no one talks about on this sub is that to get that low rate, I needed to pay back my loans within 5y, meaning I had to make payments of $1.4k approximately every month. I did the back of the napkin math and assumed that I'd be doing consulting for the next five years (I left the industry a year or so later. Oop.)

*Living in Europe for 3y+ while working at a startup*

* I moved to Europe in 2018 to pursue a career in a different industry at a small start-up. This meant an initial very painful pay cut to making about \~$50k a year. Given that I decided to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I had to cut costs in order to make those monthly payments. I knew HAD to make and stick to a budget. It was tough at first, but what really helped was doing activities that didn't require payment (like going on hikes on the weekend, going to free museum nights...etc). What also helped was cutting back on going out to eat, to the club, to the bar..etc. I also moved in with my partner to help afford things and we divvied up monthly costs (living with people always helps keep costs down).

*Getting a well paying job mid-2020*

* I transitioned to a job in my same field that paid me \~$90k around 2020. This job has also provided me with the ability to get rewards for things like referrals, which I've also been able to capitalize on.

**Other things to note..**

*Living life is important.*

* While living in Europe, I've travelled to several countries (pre-pandemic). One way to keep costs down was to use low cost carriers like EasyJet, RyanAir..etc. Another way to keep costs down was by doing weekend trips. We jump on the plane on a Thursday or Friday evening and then come back home on Sunday. Only sometimes did I stay somewhere over a week, it was rare though. Airbnbs were the best bet. Although staying in hotels in certain cities was also super affordable.

*Work at a job that you will enjoy* *or think you will mostly enjoy and learn from*

* One rule of thumb I've been following is to only take jobs I know that I'm going to enjoy AND learn AND develop my skills at. (And yes, that is an extreme privilege.) The industry I'm working in is also related to a hobby of mine. By doing this, I've been able to put in the hours for the job (the time and grind), without feeling like it's been eating away at my life.

*You need a budget*

* You do. It really helped me figure out how I could afford to continue making these crazy payments over some years (like in 2019). Start with a shitty spreadsheet that you can only read and refine from there.

*(****Not financial advice****) Investing on the side worked for me.*

* Sure, it's taken me longer than some people on this sub to pay off my loans, but don't forget to take advantage of investing opportunities (*not financial advice*). I weighed up the monthly interest rate payments of my student loan with the ROI I could be getting from other investment vehicles. DYOR though. And don't go all in on DOGE rn. Just don't.

Tried to keep this short but it became a wall of text. But hopefully it'll be useful for someone. Even when the going got tough, I loved reading people's detailed posts about how they were able to pay their loans off. It was so inspiring. So, I'm trying to pay it back to the sub.

n6wzow,PSA for PSLFers: Perkins Loans - BIG Savings,"TLDR: Federal Perkins Loans? 0 payments, 5 years of service, 100% forgiven.

After a recent conversation with program directors from my law school I learned that way too many people don't know about this huge money saver if you have **FEDERAL PERKINS LOANS.** Summarizing the email I disseminated to my class mate's and school staff:

The Perkins Loan Forgiveness Program may be overlooked because it is often labelled as the ""Perkins Loan Teacher Cancellation"" and advertised as a program for teachers, however, it is far from being limited to only teachers. The program is actually open to an even broader group of employment types than the PSLF with a few potential exceptions (may not apply to clerks or court/judge staff attorneys). 

This program is even better than the PSLF because: 1. It is shorter (5 years not 10); 2. It is based off years of service rather than number of payments; and 3. If used correctly can actually result in a cancellation of debt without the borrower having to make a single payment.

 The program cancels a portion of the debt for every year of employment in a qualified position - with **100% cancellation after 5 years**. Again, the cancellation of debt is contingent on **qualified employment** **NOT** **qualified payments**. Additionally, during each year of qualified employment, a borrower can apply for deferment based solely off of qualified employment. Essentially, a borrower can apply for a Public Service Deferment for 5 years, then after the fifth year, have the loan forgiven.",8,0,StudentLoans,1527

Anyways, as I said in the title I received a message from Navient saying that my loans would be entering repayment soon. I wasn't expecting this because I thought all loans were in forbearance due to covid which pushed back payments until September 30th. When I first log in I see the big message that says ""One or more of your loans have been granted a forbearance...""  
  
I currently have 3 loans:

-Loan 2: Direct Grad PLUS  
-Loan 3: Direct Loan - Unsubsidized

Loan 2 says that the loan status is ""National Emergency Forbearance-Ends 09/30/2021"", but loans 1 and 3 both say that the status is ""In Grace"" and that Repayment Start Date is 5/26/2021 then a little further down it says the schedule begin date is 7/12/2021  
  
Is there a reason that loans 1 and 3 wouldn't be in forbearance like loan 2 is? Is this just an error that got changed by mistake either by me or someone else, or do those loans not qualify for forbearance?  
  
Edit Update:  **I just got off the phone with Navient and they said that the 2 Unsubsidized loans are currently ""in grace"", but once the planned repayment time starts it will automatically enroll into the forbearance program. The PLUS loan just goes straight into repayment which is why that one is already in forbearance. So the guy said not to worry about it because I don't have to do anything.

Roughly $75 is being garnished from his SSI monthly due to the loan.  He's in no position financially to be able to pay off the loan, as it totals roughly $77k now.  His credit was already in bad shape, so he doesn't care too much that this loan makes it even worse.

He's currently being contacted periodically by ACS (Automated Collection Services), hunting him down for payment.  He has no assets (home, car, etc.) and very little cash in his bank accounts.  Also doesn't have a 401k or any sort of retirement savings.

Considering that he's elderly and has no plans to take out another loan or borrow from any banks for the rest of his life -

I'm currently about to enter my last year as a psych grad student. I have about 80k in debt atm. I was one of the lucky ones to benefit from the pandemic, as I made way more through unemployment and have about $13k total saved up, with my bills paid for the next two months.

Here's my predicament: My last year of grad school is essentially paying to work for free. Sept-Dec I will be expected to work around 25-30 hours at the psych clinic, then from January on will be my internship (most likely working for free for 600 hours). Fall semester will cost about $2500 for tuition credits, and then spring semester about $1250, summer and fall being the same if I have to go that long.

My question is this: Do I pay for tuition out of pocket to not take out more loans? Do I take loans to cover my tuition and use my savings to cover COL (I won't be able to work much and my bills are about $1100 a month)? Is there another better option to minimize debt to finish off?

But, is there no way for a particular borrower (like myself) to compel NCT to prove ownership of my loan(s), WITHOUT going info default?  You see, I've pretty much been a perfect borrower to them, making all payments.  Despite this, I've paid them about $30k on a loan with an original amount of $28k, and I still owe them a whopping $26k on the debt (largely due to capitalization of the interest of the loan while I was in grad school - this loan was for undergrad).  But it seems that proving ownership of the loan(s) only becomes an issue when the s\*\*t hits the fan and a borrower defaults - and NCT/the servicer has to sue.

I certainly don't want to do a ""strategic default"" in order to force NCT to prove ownership, but is there any other way?

I have all transaction history since Disbursement. Though the balances before they went from Sallie Mae to Navient are not reported.   


Initial disbursements for 4 private loans are (24k, 27k, 27k and 14k (sisters loan) between 2005 - 2007  


I see a lot of Capitalized interest charges. I'm assuming these came from when loans were in deferment or something while we were still in school.   


Anyway, In 2009 It appears that may be when they sold to Navient. But for some reason the balance for the 4 loans has  increased by a significant amount.  Up to 60.9k,67k,62k,  38k respectively. $136,442 more than it should be.

Short story version is I put my trust into the wrong lawyer and they actually conned me out of $15k while ignoring me and my loans for 3yrs. So not only was I conned out of $150k by a for-profit joke of a school, I was also taken by the lawyer I thought would help me with private loans. LOL!!! Not actually funny but story of my life so can't help but laugh at this point. Anyways though...

I have 2 private defaulted loans remaining. One I have a settlement arrangement with. I have one more year to pay it off (we worked out an extended timeline as a precaution due to the pandemic). Well...I have the ability to pay the rest of it off now, if I want. Or, I can keep the money in my account and just make my normal payments throughout the next year. I'm kind of thinking of paying it off now, just to try and help my credit start to recover a little sooner.

However, this loan was originally owned by the same company that has my final and LARGEST loan out there. I've heard nothing about this final loan in years. I don't know who owns it. Non-con artist lawyer I have advised me to ignore that loan and just keep saving *for now.* There's not much I can do when I'm broke, so save up and prepare and eventually either they'll come to me or I'll go to them and we'll get it all sorted out and be done with the private loans for good. I'm not ready for that one to come into play yet though. I just don't have enough funds yet but I AM working on it. It's just such a large amount that I need more time to save and prepare. 

**Here's my concern:** Does anyone know, if I pay off my settlement deal early, is it possible that could trigger a company into thinking I have money, and realize they should come after me for my 3rd and final private loan well before they may have intended too?",2,1,StudentLoans,1860

I am married and our household income will be 330k starting out. We have a mortgage on our house and don't expect our finances to change much post-residency.

* Refinance private loan, pay minimum payments (assuming < 3% interest through First Republic) 
* Refinance private loan, throw a big chunk of cash + bonus at that balance

Tbh, I was so grateful to get the predatory 9%-11% loans off the table and locked into a nice single 5.25% loan for the first step of the ""ladder"" that I don't know if I thought about this granular question that I'm about to ask.

Fast forward two years, and I've been able to facilitate another HUGE step for SO regarding loans--> just knocked the 5.25% down to 4.04% AND was able to get loan entirely in SO's name (the last refi and original loans needed parental cosign). Given all of the frustrations with DTI and such over these years, it feels so amazing for SO to be able to look at a 4% loan with no cosigner (and hopefully no DTI / cosign issue ever again from this point forward on the ladder).

&#x200B;

This time around, I noticed that while her original principal was $156,100 or so just before the new lender disbursed the payoff amount, the new principal amount is $156,500 or so. The discrepancy adds up just fine, in accounting for the daily interest accrued during the time it took to process/disburse the new loan. **But it has me wondering... is this how it always goes? When a new lender pays off the old lender during a private refi, does the accrued interest and principal get looped together under one payment?** This essentially capitalized that interest, given SO's new principal is a few hundred more than what it was before disbursement.",4,2,StudentLoans,1478
n3t5k8,Paid off 32k since last Feb!,"Hi all,

I just want to share exciting news that I have paid off almost 32k(31,500) since Feb 2019. This was a Wells Fargo private loan and I graduated 5/2018. I started working 08/2018 and I saved up about 10k. When my loan payments began in 12/2018, I paid the minimum for 2 months until 02/2018 when I forced myself to make a big 10k payment. The loan was split into one that was 14k+ and the other was ~17k. I paid $8,000 on the 14k one and then 2,000 to the bigger one to get the interest down. From there, I closed the smaller loan 04/2018 and then began on the bigger loan. It was hard but I still live at home, don’t shop much, and try to sell things on eBay as I can. I also picked up some babysitting (minimal, maybe made about $500-600) and transcribing for a couple months (maybe $500) but this all went to my loans. Any extra $ I had that I could spend, I put towards loans. I do have a 401k but I only do 3% and I do have a savings account but this is small ($100 a month) and will be until I pay off my debt. I still have about 20k in private loans and 25k in federal. I just refinanced my 20k loans from Sallie Mae from 7-11% interest down to 3.5% interest (used credible and its through pen fed now) so I will start paying this hard. Graduating with 80k of debt while half my counterparts all had school paid for is hard and the fact that I won’t be able to buy a house or move out as soon is also hard but I am doing it!  

I also traveled to Iceland, Denver, Phoenix, Mexico, and Ireland in the past year so I could’ve paid my loan quicker but I don’t want to miss out on experiences and be miserable with just work. I am proud I was able to pay this and travel affordably (orbitz/stalking flights until they were cheap/etc.)",15,166,StudentLoans,1744

Our starting balance was about $54.5K, and we paid $67.8K when all was said and done.

I dumped my savings (my husband and I already had a emergency fund)

My mother in law moved in with us, my husband and I worked mostly opposite shifts (and some help from MIL) to eliminate our childcare costs. 

I changed jobs in Aug (my old job my hours were being cut constantly and my new job offers OT most of the time- im an RN for reference) 

I had a second  baby and only took a 3.5 week maternity leave so I didn't take any unpaid time off (love the wonderful benefits I get working in healthcare- not) 

We cut our lifestyle back (which the world made it easier to do) so we can live on my husband's income. 


And my dad died (unexpectedly) with a silver lining of leaving me ~35k that I put all to my loans.

So I will only have the 34k in federal debt.

I have qualified for $20,000 a year in Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans starting Fall 2021. Tuition is estimated to be about \~14,000 a year, not including books. I work a full time job, so as of right now, I do not need any living expenses paid for but I do live on my own and moving back in with family is not an option. I get a $1,000 grant per semester. and have no scholarships. No TA option but there are paid internships available for my final year that I will try to get, but I'm trying to assume worst case scenario so that I'm prepared. Estimated starting salary after graduating is $65-$75k in my area depending on the company.   


My question is -   
1. Can I only take out the \~14,000 a year instead of $20,000? If not, what can I do with this money? Save it for the following year and not take out loans? Pay it towards the loan while in school? I will not have extra money during the year (from my job) to pay on loans. I do have a credit card with $3,000 balance when I got hit hard during COVID last year and had a lot of emergencies but it's 0% APR for a few more months, should I dump on that?  
2. Is there a calculator I can use to figure out how much my loan would be after graduating because of interest? $14,000 tuition a year, for three years. So estimating about $42,000 in student loans. I'm not sure the interest rate right now but I emailed the financial aid office.  
3. Credit score of 735 on credit karma if refinance is recommended, should I wait until after I graduate or can I do that about half way through?

So I've decided its time to pay it off. I am able (with a loan from a family member) to pay this 2k dollars off in full currently. However while talking with the loan company she explained to me that if I enroll in loan rehabilitation, and complete the nine month repayment plan that the defaulted status will be completely removed from my credit history.

Whereas if I were to pay the loan in full it seems this would not be the case. 

To me it seems like it will be better for me and my credit score to not pay the loan in full, and to start the rehabilitation process.

I'm 23 and don't plan on needing credit for anything major

-UK student studying a 2 year MSc in Nederlands

- intended to work during degree and before I left in Sept 2020. Covid messed my job so I had less savings before I left and I couldn't find a job in NL into covid issues

- Moved to Holland. Had plumbing issues with rented property in October. Dishonest landlord didnt fix it and I became seriously ill as a result of raw sewage leaking into plumbing and water supply. As a result the room is unhabitable. 

- Went home to Uk at Christmas, Landlord said properly would be fixed by Jan. 

-Fast forward to April, landlord is still messing me around, still hasnt fixed it. He's charging me rent, still, if I dont pay he will kick me out. They have stopped responding to my requests to fix the property, I'm considering legal action but cannot afford it right now. Getting a new property is my uni city is notoriously hard.

- Am currently living with a UK relative yet if I dont go back by end of the year to complete practical part of degree I will fail the year.

- I am very low on funds as I pay rent/living costs at relatives house I'm Uk aswell as NL property. Relative is also kicking me out if I can't pay (long story...). I dont have anywhere to stay in the UK due to covid related issue and I don't want to sofa surf at my friends places as it wouldnt be a long term solution and I dont want to be a burden on them.

I'm considering having to drop out of uni because of financials. I need a loan yet I'm someone who always saves before paying something in full, I don't want intend to get Into a debt I cant currently pay back.

- I don't know if i can get a Dutch student loan, I have a BSN yet I havnt completed my Brexit visa as I need a meeting in the town hall which I cant go to as I have nowhere to stay/cant afford to I'm NL...

n24693,What’s going on with my interest?,"Hey folks. I’m in the process of trying to understand my student loans. I’ve got tons of questions but for now, I want to ask a simple one to see if that helps me answer the rest on my own. So, here it goes.

The monthly payments I’m making aren’t being consistently applied to the interest. According to my best understanding, as the principal goes down, more of your payment goes towards paying off the principal and less goes towards paying the interest. So says the excel spreadsheet I made. But when I look at the proportion of my monthly payments, the portion going to interest is varying up and down over the course of months. I do notice there is a C next to each intesrest value but I don’t know what that means. My best guess is that it means capatilized. But I can’t see why it would be. This loan has never changed its payment plan, never been late on any payments and the minimum (and then some) is paid every month. Any ideas what’s going on with the interest? 

Loan details as follows:

Starting Principal: $46,752.73

n2382l,The system is broken,"Growing up I was told that you have to go to college if you want to have anything resembling a decent life. My parents are rich enough that I qualified for no aid. Yet anyway, they said that its worth it, they both went to college and are doing well enough that I don't qualify for aid. So anyway I went to an IN-STATE school. Didn't even qualify for federal non-direct loans. Took out 30k federal, 120k private loans. Graduating this semester, took a look at my loans, and I already have about 50k of interest tacked on. College is not for everyone. I thought that the system was bad, but not horrible. I was wrong. If you are rich enough, college sounds great, if you are poor enough, college sounds great. But if you are somewhere in the middle (not really but whatever) then DO NOT GO TO IN-STATE COLLEGE, please consider community college as mentioned in one of the responses .

My two choices were work minimum wage, or go into 200k debt for college. ~~Hard to imagine, but I would have been better off making minimum wage.~~

n1inw6,Navient deferring coming to an end possibly,"TL;DNR - Loans deferred for about two decades, never defaulted but I’m afraid the end of deferring might be coming to an end. 

I have $100k - $110K in student loans that Navient is serving. I graduated in early 2000’s so it’s old debt. I gave been doing forbearance for as long as I can remember (at least a decade ++). With this debt I was able to buy a home with the ex wife years ago by deferring it for twelve months and the bank doesn’t count it as debt for your dti ratios. 

I’ve been deferring it since covid started as I was unemployed. Now I’m employed and my new payment is due in May  I’m currently employed as of March. 

At this stage I don’t know if I’ll be allowed to continue deferring the loan. This makes me think I’ll never be able to buy a house by the time my career winds down (I’m 50). I’ve never defaulted on them but my credit report shows one late for the student loans. I’m guessing it has to do with the last time I deferred it last year I must have put deferring it by a month. 

I’ve always thought that I’ll defer it for life or as long as I can and sc.rew the interest as I don’t see it ever being paid off in my lifetime even if I would start making payments. 

So my question, point of discussion: 

1. Besides possible registration in community college cheap to be able to defer for going back to school how much longer and how can I defer this? I’m a W-2 employee. 

2. I’ve come to realize at this stage of my life that I might be a renter for life if I can’t defer it going forward. This is sad bc I’m paying someone else’s mortgage as a renter. How are some of you handling the potential of not being able to buy a home due to student loans? 

3. I’m afraid of going online to see if Navient’s payment tied to income will make any difference at all. I’m afraid if putting my salary into their little calculator and then they have that on record. For the record I’m at around$90k annually.

n01426,Questions on TPD process,"Hi all.  My mother (70) has a Parent PLUS / FFEL Consolidated student loan in her name, which she took out to support my college education.

For the past several years I have been making the payments on this loan as she was struggling financially.  As of last year she was diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer's.  She stopped working in 2019 as the symptoms were beginning to affect her job performance.  

I am working through the process of applying for a TPD discharge of this loan in her name.  As of today I have started the application process on [disabilitydischarge.com](https://disabilitydischarge.com), and will be getting her physician to complete their portion of the form.

My question is: does starting the application process trigger the loan provider to be notified that payments are to be suspended until the application/review is complete, or does that only happen after the completed application is submitted?  I ask because there is a payment that'd normally be due on 5/1 that I was considering stopping on her behalf if the former is true.

mzhvml,Should I pay out of pocket or take a gamble?,"Hi Reddit! I've been toying with a few scenarios in my head and would love to get some opinions.

**Background**: I'm in my mid-20s and have about $14k left on my (federal) undergrad student loans. I've made the decision to go back to get a Master's degree. The full cost of that degree is around $50k. Currently, I have about $25k in savings (lived with parents for two years, saved aggressively while making $48k/year in an unrelated field). 

Initially, I figured that I would take out $15-20k of those savings and put it toward tuition while taking out the rest in federal loans (Stafford and Graduate Plus). Lately, however, with all this talk about federal loan forgiveness, I'm wondering if I should take out the full amount just in case some miracle does happen and Biden forgives that magical $50k amount. 

I figure that if forgiveness does not happen by the time I get my degree, I can just take that money from my savings and put it toward my balance in a huge lump sum, and then have a lower monthly payment (and less debt in general). I know that I have to account for the interest that accrues, so it's not a *total* wash, but the thought of depleting my savings that much while whispers of student debt forgiveness are circulating makes me a little wary.

I'm not operating under the assumption that any forgiveness will happen, especially for a graduate borrower, so it may not be a worthwhile risk, but...it's very tempting to *not* drain my savings on that sliver of hope.

So, to recap, the way I see it, I can either:  


1. Deplete my savings by \~80% and take out a smaller loan, ultimately taking on less debt.
2. Take out the full amount and wait until we're more certain about debt forgiveness with the intent to pay what I would have upfront if no forgiveness happens, taking the interest as a net loss. 

I'm leaning toward option 2 at the moment. What do you all think?",8,14,StudentLoans,1898
mzco13,Fell for Skyway Federal Loan Service Agreement,"So a couple of weeks ago I stayed up the entire night studying at then in the morning got a call from this company telling me they can make it so that I owe nothing in my student loans. In my state of mental delirium as a broke and  inexperienced undergrad, I agreed to their terms and was quickly walked through an e-document signing for 6 months of 200 payments to my credit card. They asked me to send a bunch of documents within 3 days to get their services as soon as possible so there was no delay in the process but I didn't have all the necessary docs prepared until today (April 26) which I sent to them via email. 

I finally did some internet research today a few hours after sending the documents and found out that the whole this was almost certainly a bunch of bull. So I immediately emailed them in response to the email I sent earlier containing the documents and told them I would like to cancel the agreement and not use their services as well as being refunded the initial deposit. That email was sent after hours though so they probably haven't seen it yet. 

I also called my credit card company and told them about it and they told me they were going to give the company 10 days to refund me before opening a case.

However, Google is saying Earnest or Education Loan Finance is the best to use. Wondering if anyone can vouch for them. 

I also saw some information about local credit unions but I’m not a member of the federal credit union/bank in my town. I currently have a credit card with Discover and TD bank. I also do not have a co-signer but have good credit.

Please let me know what you think. Thus far, I’m in $42,000 of debt from federal loans, not accounting the additional $12,500 I will take in the fall (reaching my maximum).



update: i’m going for my BSN (nursing). i have a decent chunk saved from working so i can pay a part of the $23,500 tuition remaining.

but all said and done I’ll have $57,000 in stafford loans and possibly $11,750 or $18,000 in private loans.

my options: I’ll owe my university $11,750 per year for two years 

—-> I can pay the first year myself with a few thousand left to support myself through school
—-> private loan second year

or

I’ll owe $5,500 the first year and $18,000 the second year
—-> I can pay this myself with more cushion in my savings
—> private loan second year

This all depends on how I split my remaining stafford loan between the two year program.

my2szg,Can’t believe I’m done paying off 160k!,"I graduated with my master’s with 160k in debt in 2018. I moved to the Bay Area after I graduated and opted to go on an IDR plan since cost of living was so high there. At that time, I felt that sticking to an IDR plan and just aiming for forgiveness after 20 years would be the only way I’d be able to buy a house in the near future, so I (unsuccessfully) convinced myself this would be the best for me. 

However, I felt like having such a large amount of debt would eat me up (and it did), and I definitely did not want to have this huge burden on my back for 20 years. I remember how I felt hopeless every time a payment went through, only for my principal balance to pretty much stay the same because of interest. A few months after my move to the Bay Area, however, I ended up finding pretty much the same position back in LA and moved in with my parents and basically lived off an Excel spreadsheet. I rarely ate out, I cut down on random expenses on drinks (tea and coffee), and though I budgeted $400 a month to spend on myself, I never used anywhere near that, so I just ended up paying more towards my loans than I planned to. Of course, there were times when I would spend more than the spreadsheet would allow, but for the most part, I disciplined myself to stick to the budget.

Fast forward to April 2021, I’m finally done! I can’t believe it. I’ve been extremely fortunate to have been able to move in with my parents - this really allowed me to save so much. 

To people who think it’s the end of the world: hang in there, as I was on the same boat. Be extremely cautious with how you spend, and if you can, move in with your parents or get a roommate. Housing tends to take up a huge portion of your paycheck, so getting that lower is ideal. 

Next month will be my first month where I don’t live by an Excel spreadsheet, and I can’t wait!

UPDATE: I see that some of you were asking about my salary. I started at 69k, then got bumped up to 76k in the Bay Area - you can see why I had to go with IDR. When I moved back home, I ended up with a 100k salary (I got promoted in 2020). Also, I had about 20k saved up from basically my entire childhood (I don’t remember the exact number, but it was definitely not more than 25k). Hope that helps! Good luck to everyone!

UPDATE #2: I’m also 28 now. The ~20k I had saved up basically comes from birthday money (for 20+ years) and jobs I took on while I was in undergrad (I worked for 3 out of 4 years, part time of course).

UPDATE #3: I’m just trying to revisit my memories, and I forgot to mention that I did work full-time for two summers while I was an undergrad (I probably saved about 7k just from that). Also, when I was in grad school, I worked about 20 hours a week as a research assistant (got paid 25 an hour). Even after I graduated and worked full-time, my professor wanted me to continue working for her whenever I had time, so of course, I crammed in 10-15 hours a week if I wasn’t feeling overwhelmed.",46,262,StudentLoans,2979

mxykx2,Strategy For Paying Off Student Loans,"Hey Folks! I posted this in r/personalfinance just to hear what they have to say but I would appreciate some advice here as well! I have around 38k in student loans, 22k is private and the rest is public. The public loans consist of 7 individual loans with varying interest rates. I have not payed anything on the public loans since last year when the principal and interest was suspended. I have been paying the $330 a month on my private loans because obviously, those aren't affected by the federal pause. Here is my scenario: I can pay off all of my loans today and be completely debt free with about $10k left for living expenses, but I want to be smart about it. I don't think the government will do anything about my private loans so instead of paying the $330 every month would paying them off now be the best thing to do? As far as my public loans go, I have heard so many varying things on student loan forgiveness I can't keep track of everthing. I don't want to get into a situation where I pay my public loans off and then Biden forgives 10K and I lose out on that money that I could have saved if I had literally done nothing. I also understand that those loans aren't hurting me at all and I would rather have more money in my savings and in my emergency fund then throwing it at the balance when an unexpected life event could come up (my 12 year old car has high mileage) and I would need that. I am antsy to do something about these loans because when these are payed off, I will be completly debt free which will feel great, however, I will need to start the brutal process of saving up for a downpayment on a house.

mxx9sr,Quite the pickle. Northeastern vs Binghamton,"So I'm in quite the pickle and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm currently down to either Northeastern or SUNY Binghamton for college. I like Northeastern better in every aspect except for the money. If I went to Binghamton my parents would cover the costs but if I go to Northeastern I would have to take out around 25-30k in loans every year. After doing some calculations, I'd probably have around 90k in loans after graduation. Here are the reasons I'm still considering Northeastern.

&#x200B;

1. I plan on majoring in Computer Science at NEU which has a very high median salary directly after graduation (around 88k). According to most loan recommendations, you shouldn't take out a loan greater than what you expect to make after 1 year of working.
2. Computer Science co-ops pay well so I would use a lot of the money to cover as much of the loan as I can. Binghamton isn't in a big city like Boston so internship opportunities aren't as good. I wouldn't expect to get a good internship / make a lot of money while in school at Bing.
3. Because of the credits that I have from high school, ill be able to at least get rid of at least one full summer term at northeastern. (English, stats, elective, calc) I would not have to pay tuition for those summer semesters so in total I would save tuition for one semester.
4. I don't really want to go to Binghamton and knowing myself if I end up miserable I won't be motivated to try academic-wise. Binghamton also has a fairly significant lower median directly after graduation for cs majors (72k). Not to mention I applied to Binghamton planning on doing a business major then doing a master's. I was interested in Northeastern CS because of the schedule flexibility for cs majors and the co-op program. Binghamton I heard has a lot of gen-ed courses which I'm not really interested in.

Any advice would be very helpful. I plan on committing within the next few days.",22,2,StudentLoans,1921

I graduated back in December. I’m about to begin paying off student loans. I have three:
$25,000 through Great Lakes, a federal loan. 4.75%.

$4000 in my parents name as a parent PLUS loan. 7.60%. 

$6500 in a private Sallie Mae loan. 10%.

Obviously the Sallie Mae loan and parent plus loan are very high interest rates. I’m wondering if refinancing all of these into one loan is the way to go, but I have a few questions.

1) is it possible to refinance the parent plus loan from my parents name into my name? 

2) I understand that any government issued student loan forgiveness wouldn’t apply to me if I refinance the Great Lakes loan. In this case, would it be better I leave the Great Lakes loan alone, and just refinance the other two? Or do you think the odds of the student loan forgiveness are so slim that I should just refinance all of them?

I have a $65,000 salary. Credit score is 740ish and naturally should only improve as time goes on, no credit card debt. Currently in the process of moving and also trying to build up my emergency fund.. I likely wouldn’t pull the trigger with refinancing until December or January. Minimum payments for now. By that point, I’ll be prepared to shell out 600-900 a month for loans, haven’t crunched the numbers perfectly yet but that’s looking like the range of what I could contribute once I stop saving to my emergency fund.

She has 3 semesters left of undergrad. She was initially planning on paying tuition out of pocket (working adult student) but I suggested instead applying those lump sum amounts to her private loans and taking out federal loans for the same amount.

The way I see it, there are only pros to this situation. She would still owe the same amount overall. The new federal loans would likely be at a much lower interest rate, even if the current 0% interest does not get extended. Whatever amount she can take in subsidized loans won’t start accruing interest until after she graduates, whereas the private loans are currently already accruing interest.

Are there any cons to this idea that I’m missing here or anything else I should consider? Thanks in advance!

I have not paid Navient on the bs loan that Westwood staff lied and coerced me into applying to on my behalf in more than 5 years - going on 6 by December 2021. When I would ask Navient for copies or paperwork of the loan to prove that no fraud took place. The operator would always say that they were looking right at it right then and there, but they still never sent me anything. (Westwood staff told me the paperwork they were applying for on my behalf was “financial aid,” not a loan)

It is my understanding that the statue of limitations for private student loans in California (where I reside) is 4 years. Navient would send me emails, and I would never respond to them, until they stopped in January of 2021.

mvjb80,Borderline Between Emergency Funds and Excess Debt Funds,"I have about $5K+ in emergency fund savings I don't touch and as a habit I save about $150 a month to continously add to it. I know I need about $1K a month at least to pay the bills if an emergency happens and there is a good amount in there in case something happens.

I have a large amount of private school loan debt at 42K spread over two small loans and three big loans. I'm not in the position to refinance so the interest is at least paid on all three big loans. My goal is to pay off one or both of the two small loans hopefully by the end of this year giving me roughly ten months to do it.

I pay nearly $400 a month and lot is lost to interest, but the loans are shrinking slowly, but not growing either. I'm using the snowball approach for win, by win, by win. I'm not sure if my loan repayment plan has the option to dump all principal to one loan, but still pay interest on the bigger loans, still working on that.

Numbers so far is I save an extra 150 a month and once that's saved I use the 150 the next month as an extra payment. Any OT I get I do the same. And I got a raise so that's about an extra 125 as well. Anything else I can get I do the same. So I try to make an extra payment somewhere in the neighborhood of 350 +/- If all goes well throufhout the month.

Here is some interesting things I found. I hope this can lead to some discussion, inspire others, and help current students plan. Beware, math isn't perfect and there is some capitalized interest in there that makes things not add to 100%.

My salary in the wildlife sciences is 52K at a non-profit. I certify my employment once a year. Still have a good number of years to go and I'm not planning on relying on PSLF. 10 years is a long time. Id rather not put all my eggs in the government basket.

In total I had 9 loans. 8 direct, and 1 FFEL that was of the 10% that was bought back by the government. I have been snowballing my payments. I have not consolidated. 

For additional reference I served a half year in Americorps in-between CC and uni, and joined the Army National Guard after having gotten my Masters. Upon enlistment you choose between the GI bill OR Student Loan Repayment. Having 3 degrees I chose the latter. They will pay 15% of your outstanding principle for every good year for up to 6 years. This comes with an annual tax bomb, which is included in my math. I have had 2 payments to date.

\* There were multiple semesters where I was less than half-time and didn't qualify for aid. I paid out of pocket as I was working full time (totaling $10,170). None of the companies I worked for at the time had any college tuition programs. I took out some personal loans (which I quickly paid off) to pay for a class or too. For my own personal book keeping reasons I choose to apply my post tax $7000 dollar Army enlistment bonus in this calculation, as right after school I paid off the personal loans/ sort of ""paid myself"" with it.

Additionally, this graduate program had a special tuition structure that includes all of the fees which was less than typical out of state graduate tuition. Books were minimal. I was a full time ""adult"" working, paying undergraduate loans, and supporting my small family at the time; so I choose not to bother with a COL calculation.

&#x200B;

My biggest take-aways:

I'm upset at how much university ""fees"" add up. Some of these are excessive. Library fee? Sure. Lab fees? Okay. Mandatory bus fee? What if I don't use the university bus? Recreation fee? I don't have time to use the stupid rock wall (although I did use the gym showers because our water pressure was trash). Funny how it was the 4 year university that made me pay all the crap.

I did use the student health care center though, as my out of state insurance had an unreasonably high deductible that I was functionally uninsured, and I hurt my foot really bad senior year. (American healthcare is for a different sub)

It's insane to me that out of 3 degrees each being the equivalent of 2 years of education that my undergraduate university took up 50% of my total education costs. And that is on top of a poverty-like lifestyle. 

Pell grants need an update. I've seen the argument of people trashing on 10k loan forgiveness because ""poor people already get free community college with Pell grants. Everyone who took out loans were middle class"". Yeah... that's not true. 

It pays to not fail. I am so lucky that I never failed and had to retake a class, because that is just cost that adds up. Or even switching majors. I'm so lucky I didn't switch majors, because that is even more extra classes. To anyone reading this that is going to school soon. Please do undecided as long as possible. Or if you can't do that, front load all of your general education classes at the beginning. Or even better yet. Take a year off to mature and figure out what you want.

Life isn't a race. At any stage of education I think paying out of pocket should be considered more. My last year in University was half-time so I could afford living expenses. Sometimes I only took one class at a time during grad school as I could afford it. Better to live a little leaner than taking out a loan you aren't sure you can afford.

To anyone reading this that is considering military. If you do, don't be like me and pick the SLRP. The GI bill is worth way way way way more. SLRP is ONLY worth it when you 100% know that you are done getting degrees. It worked for me, but I'm a special kind of special who chose to enlist in a dirt pushing MOS with a Master's degree.

Please consider community college and test credits (AP, CLEP). Just look at the money I likely saved. Also if your in HS max out on AP, and dual credit if it's free. If your in school google Freshman Year for Free. I got my AS in only 1 year because of testing credits.

&#x200B;

Do I think all of this was worth it? Mostly yes. I enjoyed my education, and while low paying, my Master's degree landed me a good job in a good city. I live a good life and my overall loans were less than my starting salary. Both after my BS and my MS.

What would I change? I wish I would have treated some substance issues I was having earlier on in my life. I'll admit. Some of the COL went to things it shouldn't have that I'm much happier without.

One through American Education Services ($11,157.83) and the other through Fedloan Servicing ($74,824.46). I am working on paying off the smaller loan, but realistically the large loan will never be repaid in full. I don't make enough money. I have been making my IDR payments towards both loans for close to 10 years now and plan on continuing to make payments on the large loan until my 20 years are up and I hit the forgiveness requirements and tax bomb. 

I understand that I haven't been required to make any payments since March 2020, but I have continued to make those payments because I didn't want to miss ""qualifying"" IDR payments and push back my 20 year forgiveness period. However, I just realized today that even if I hadn't been making those payments, they would have still counted as qualifying, $0 payments towards my IDR forgiveness date. 

Now that I have had this realization, my plan is to request a refund from FedLoan Servicing for the payments that I have made since last March and then pay that refund towards the smaller AES loan (which I have an actual chance of paying off soon). 

I'm just looking for general advice to make sure that my plan is solid and I am not missing anything. Can anyone with more knowledge of the process check my logic to make sure that I am understanding everything correctly?

mutnd7,Strategy Review - REPAYE into Refinance for Residency with Low Salary,"Hey everyone!

I have a strategy to pay off my loans that if I could get your thoughts on any weaknesses, that would be appreciated. For some quick context, I have $129,000 in federal unsubsidized loans @ an avg interest of 6%. I will be working in private sector and have no interest in PSLF.

I'm a recent pharmacy graduate, but I will be entering a residency program for about 2 years. In year 1 and year 2, I will make about $50,000. Then after year 2, I will make about $125k+ and will refinance my loans. 

My plan to maximize ROI is to enroll in REPAYE for the 2 years I'm in residency because my salary will be low and to get the unpaid interest subsidy from the government. 

I did some math, and the subsidy would cover 50% of my unpaid interest ($370*0.50), which would be $185 while I pay about $266 (based off $50k income). 

Some questions I had are:

1. One weakness of my plan is that when I switch off from REPAYE, my unpaid interest will capitalize. If I have the funds, should I pay off the unpaid interest that the subsidy did not cover for 2 years in order to avoid this capitalization event?

2. How does the transition period work when it comes to my REPAYE payment for year 3 when I move from $50k salary to $125k salary?

mujm4o,"$124,000 down to $67,500","Hi,

I thought I'd share my student loan journey.  It's far from over but I'm feeling good about the progress.  I graduated from an MSW program in 2016 at age 29 with a total of $124,000 in student debt: 82,000 from grad school and 42,000 left from undergrad.  I was in a low paying fellowship for a year after graduating and then spent a good year paying off credit card debt and growing an emergency fund.  Now I take home about $5800/month after taxes and put $3000 toward loans.  I have $35,000 in savings (15,000 of this is included in what I subtracted from my total loan) and plan to throw all but $20,000 at the debt once the Covid forbearance is over.  82,500 - 15,000 in savings = 67,500 with 20,000 emergency fund. 

When I took my loans out I planned to pay down about $25,000 per year hoped to be done by the time I was 35.  Well in reality I lagged for the first few years (it took a couple of years to get financially stable and then I blew some money once I started to ""feel"" like I had some) and honestly didn't think I could do it but my income increased and I got serious about this, made a budget, sold my car and now I'm back on track.  My remaining loans are  federal with an average 6.5% interest and the Covid forbearance is a big help.  It also helped to talk to a friend who successfully paid off her 80,000 debt - I regained confidence that I am able to manage my money and do this.

mumcwu,Tips on private loans,"I go to a state school where my entire tuition is covered through grants and scholarships. However, this means I still need to pay for dorming. I am a freshman and my entire first year was online due to the pandemic, so I stayed at home and didn't need to worry about that. But fall 2021 semester has been declared to be in person, so I need to live on campus.

My school has a mandatory meal plan if you dorm, so the total cost for room and board will be around $6k per semester. As far as I know I can take up to $5.5k in federal loans per year, which mean I need to worry about paying the rest (about $6k per year). So far my only option is taking out private loans, but I have barely any idea about them.

So my questions are: would you consider this a good deal/investment? I am a physics major so I expect to at least make a decent amount of money. Do private loans get deferred in grad school along with federal loans? What are some tips/advice you can give? I am super nervous because all over the internet I hear how private loans f-ed people over. Why is there such negative stigma why is it discouraged so much ?",24,3,StudentLoans,1123

To attend any of these schools, my calculated EFC would leave me personally bearing easily over $35k annually of private student loans. My question is, do any pre-med students ever go this far in debt to attend these schools, especially when grad school loans loom in the distance. Is it worth it? Is the prospect of earning a large income after training going to compensate for this large initial investment? The alternative is going to University of Florida or University of Miami, each gave me significant merit scholarships where I will go for nearly free and those offers are highly appealing.

mtqv4o,Choosing an Undergrad Program,"Hi there, I'm graduating high school this year and looking to pursue a CS bachelor's starting next fall. I have a few offers from different universities and was hoping for some insight on debt before I make a financial commitment to any of these schools. I have admission offers from:  

  

\- University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (BSE) - 23k/year after aid - graduate with \~30k debt  

\- Boston University (BA) - 17k/year after aid - graduate with \~5-10k debt  

\- Florida State University (BS) - Full ride - graduate with no debt  

  

Michigan is the best school of the three by far, and the town and school culture is my favorite of the three. It is also the closest to home (Central Illinois), and I can take the Amtrak line directly to my hometown rather than having to fly. It has a fantastic CS program and industry reputation, and lots of well-paid internship opportunities. I'll more easily be able to explore other engineering disciplines in conjunction with CS. The median base salary for a Michigan CS grad is [$100,000](http://career.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2019/04/annualreport1718.pdf), while that of an FSU CS grad is [$66,041](https://career.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu746/files/2018-2019%20Salary%20and%20Hiring%20Data.pdf).   

  

However, the price difference between Michigan and FSU is (very) large. I'm fortunate to be able to cover over half the net cost without taking out loans, but for the remaining \~8k per year I would need to go into debt. I would appreciate any advice in approaching this decision. Are the post-grad opportunities and experience of UM worth taking out loans?

First, my parents make a decent bit of money on paper, but they weren't great with their money when I was young and now they're bankrupt and in a huge debt. Being that FAFSA doesn't consider that, though, I'm not eligible for any Pell grants or more than like 5k in loans/semester.

In my state, we have a program that offers to pay \~ tuition cost, but it only lasts for four years, and I'm about to go into my fifth (and final) semester. Even with the program, I still owed over $1500 a semester, and without it, there's no way I could afford that.

I've talked to financial aid and they said that they didn't know of anything I could do. I already tried the parent plus loan and was declined which led to me being loaned the $2500 out of the $5k that I'm eligible for. Another thing is, is that I go to one of the cheapest schools in my state, and I can't afford out-of-state tuition anywhere else.

I'm so close to graduating and I really need to finish the degree. I was wondering if there was any way I could get a private loan without a cosigner. I've tried ascent, discover, sallie mae, and more, but for one reason or another I get declined. I already work part time at a restaurant and that helps with the $1500 I pay every semester, but with it being exponentially more now, there's simply no way that could cut it.

Does anyone know of any possible ways I could be eligible for more financial aid due to my parents' bankruptcy? Or is there any possible way I could take out more money in student loans somehow? Sorry if this seems like an impossible ask; I'm just not sure what to do at this point.

Edit: If it matters, I file my taxes independent, but I am not viewed as independent to FAFSA.",5,1,StudentLoans,1770

In my senior year, I had to take out private loans. I went to the school financial aid office and don’t remember discussing payment plans with the person who helped me fill out the loan request.

Pros

\- the Honors College has perks like small classes, free trips, increased transferability, and I would be surrounded by intelligent people

\- Completely free

Cons

\- I would have to buy a car to transport myself

\- Would be hard to find internships or get hands-on experience

\- I would lose two years of networking

Georgia Tech:

Pros

\- Obviously the prestige

\- Great career resources

\- The overall quality of students and staff would be better

\- Located in Atlanta near a good amount of tech

Cons

\- I would have to take out a MAX of $75k in loans if things don't go to plan but I intend to graduate with around $50k

ms9ayo,Possible to game IDR with strategic career breaks?,"Hey guys, first time poster here. I have $68K combined undergraduate/law school debt, which isn't bad, but ideally I'd like to keep payments to a minimum. Looking for some feedback on a hypothetical scenario.

I graduated law school in May 2020, and have spent the last year saving up to quit my job and pursue other (non income-generating) interests. I made good money in 2020, but will 100% be unemployed by choice when payments become due in September. From my research, it looks like I can base my first IDR calculation on my unemployed status at that time instead of using last year's tax return (which would naturally give me much higher payments). This alone is great.

But this alternative way of calculating things led me to wonder: If my plan is just to work short-term jobs for the next few years (I'll be traveling the rest of the time), couldn't I strategically make sure I'm unemployed every time the filing deadline comes around and lock in $0/month payments indefinitely? Apparently you don't have to recertify early if you are unemployed at the time of filing, find a job later in the year, and experience an increase in income (or so the internet tells me). Instead, it's just an option for if your income decreases and you need to ease your financial burden before the next recertification. If this is the case, it would seem in theory you can continue paying $0/month just by being unemployed at the right time of year, but still make money in the meantime. I don't know if this is genius or too good to be true, though I suspect it's probably the latter! Any thoughts on this idea?

Disclaimer: I know the ethical thing to do would be to enjoy the $0 payments this fall, then recertify as soon as I get a job. But I couldn't resist exploring a potential loophole. Thanks in advance!",30,6,StudentLoans,1803

As the title states, I’m 27 years old with approximately $170k in student loans. I just recently finished grad school and will be starting a new job that pays roughly $200k/year (I make a specific production percentage, so this will vary a little). I’ve used extra money I’ve made in the past year to eliminate all of my other debt (paid off about $10k in credit cards in a little over 18 months). In addition to my salary above, I’ve also received a $20k signing bonus and approximately $3-5k in additional yearly credit for continuing education costs since I’m in the medical field.

I anticipate having roughly $7-10k in savings before starting my job and will likely be paying roughly $2k/month for all living expenses in the city I’m heading to (SLC). I’ll be looking to max out my Roth IRA and 401k yearly.

Given the current news about Biden investigating student loan forgiveness and with no interest accruing through September, how should I best go about paying this off? Assuming I pay roughly $30k per year in living expenses (this is rounded up a bit from what I mentioned above), as well as assuming I take home approximately $130k after retirement contributions, should I be looking to pay this off as quickly as possible in a year or two? My concern is the interest rate is only about 5.5%, so I’m worried I should be focusing on allocating a fair portion to the stock market instead given an anticipated 7% year return.

mr1q64,Good Credit and stable pay but excessive obligations thanks to co-signers: Can I still get refinanced?,"Put simply, I've got a lot of different student loans I'm paying. My college was pretty pricey and my parents took out individual loans over multiple semesters to get tuition paid. It's not my ideal situation but when it comes down to it things have so far worked out well. My parents handle some of the loan payments, I handle others (generally the most pricey ones), and for the few years I've been out of college there hasn't been too many problems. I've had good credit for years now, I've got a well paying job out of college that lets me handle all my own payments and save money, my parents pay what part they said they would, and now I've saved up enough money to even pay off one of the smaller loans now if I wanted to. Everything up to this point has been easy enough to manage.

The problem is that two of these loans under the same lender my parents were paying, against my knowledge, were in graduated payment all this time and has now switched over to standard, increasing the monthly payments to basically double what they were before, far more than I (and I expect them as well) expected. After checking to make sure other surprises like this weren't coming up with my other loans, this left me in a bit of a pickle.

Financially I can pay about half of that total payment every month without issue, or even pay off one of the loans entirely, and still be well enough off on my own. Though a greater cost it doesn't personally bum me out too much because I can theoretically do it and I don't want them to be dealing with a burden on my behalf. But my parents keep encouraging me to look into refinancing for a cheaper rate instead, as they want to pay on my behalf and don't want me to take on that extra cost. On paper that sounds great to me, get a good deal that lowers the total monthly payments, they pay it, I don't need to worry. And I've been getting a ton of letters from refinancing companies saying I'm pre-approved to check this or that deal out, so that at one point filled me with a lot of confidence.

Except of course, as the title of this post reveals, to anyone not familiar with my financial situation this just looks like one guy with a lot of debts and money that's not paying it all. Previous attempts to refinance have ended in rejection due to my excessive obligations, even though all of the monthly payments have been paid and everything else on my end should look good. Thankfully I haven't done any that require a hard credit check just yet so my credit is still remaining good, but I fear what further attempts might do.

Ideally I'd like to refinance these few loans under my own name, have my parents do what they were doing previously and return to how things have been going so far. But most places won't even look at me without a co-signer and the ones that will have rejected me. I could potentially get a co-signer out of my parents again but with my ever increasing skepticism with my parents' loan sense I'd prefer to be as independent with these as I can.

So what's my best call here?   
Just ignore what my parents say and take on part of the monthly payments/pay off one of the smaller loans to ease the burden?   
Just get a cosigner and need to worry more about potential shenanigans in the future?

Estimated costs for everything is:  $**34,275**

I get $24,629 in grants a year, and the net price comes out to $9646. The loans they want me to take out are $7446 per year. These loans are broken down into :

* $3.5k/ year for a federal direct subsidized loan at 2.75% interest
* $1946/year for federal direct unsubsidized loans at 2.75% interest
* $5k/year for institutional loans at 5% interest

The net price for my family is quite daunting and we are considering taking loans out, but I do not know if that is a smart financial move. I plan on going into premed and I'm worried about the additional loans if I attend med school.  I am majoring in biology, so I'm not sure if I would be able to pay it off if I don't go become a doctor. Another option is to go to a lower-ranked state school that offers me a full ride. I do not know if it is justifiable to take out loans for a ""dream school.""

I appreciate any help I can get, thank you!

UPDATE: I didn't really expect this many replies! THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ADVICE AND SUPPORT. I will definitely keep in mind the biology major thing. I only really chose it because I knew it was like the thing to do if you wanted pre-med and enjoyed it in HS. I will definitely keep in mind if I really do want to pursue this path through later experience in college and wish to continue with premed.

I also thank you for the loan information. I really had no clue before posting this. Thanks for explaining how they work and if it really is doable or not. Also, I never even had the idea to have a minor in something else either as security, so that was also really helpful.

To conclude, I really appreciate all the help you've given me and now I have a much clearer idea of how to approach this. Sorry, it became kinda more college orientated, but thank you for this advice too because I did not really know much about college before this year either. This was also like my first serious post on Reddit, so cheers to you all!

mqqp6i,SBA small business loan and defaulted federal student loans,"Hi, this is bad and complicated and now I am terrified.

So I have a lot of federal student loans. I literally don't know how much, but I think one letter I read from a while ago said I had defaulted $17,000 in current payments due. I have been out of grad school for like 10 year, plus four years of undergrad before that. I literally have never made one payment to them. It has to be at least a couple 100k that I total owe by now. 

Now my family and I are starting a small business. Everything is in my partner and his mother's name because I have bad credit, but I had to fill out the questionnaire form that gets submitted to the SBA including the question, have you taking out federal student loans, since I am ""essential to the business"". My partner and I are not legally married (mostly because of this)  

Does anyone have any advice on this or thoughts on resources I can reach out to? I am afraid to even look on [studnetaid.gov](https://studnetaid.gov) because I was worried it would bring attention to me. Because some how, it is not on my credit history, it has not garnished wages, and I haven't gotten letters or calls or anything about it in years. I do not know why. I have moved a lot and my name is a little bit common, but that seems absurd, I really don't know why. 

We have been waiting on this SBA loan for almost a year, now it is finally time to submit it to the SBA and I am trying to figure out what I am going to do if they send it back and reject us or have questions because of that.

I know this sounds horrible but I was in a lot of debt, had no money, and the thought of being able to make payments ever seemed impossible. Now I am all caught up on all of the debt besides this, including being current on my private student loans. My partner knows but the rest of the people involved in starting this business do not.

As a lot of the money goes into his hospital bills and the interests are racking up, I am looking for the best options to consolidate the loans. 

I don't think my parent has paid for any of the interests and my sibling would already have about $150+ under her name by the time she graduates from med school.

mqb39p,Servicer says Rehabilitating a Loan Means High Monthly Payments- is this true?,"I have multiple loans that are ten years old and in default, totaling 30k. I am interested in rehabilitating or consolidating to resolve all of these debts, but I am starting with a 5k Perkins Loan that is causing a hold on my transcript from my school that I need resolved as soon as possible. My school said they don't need the balance paid in full, just ""set up an agreement and/or find out your repayment options"" with the servicer. 

I called the servicer, they explained I could consolidate or rehabilitate. They strong recommended consolidating (even though most advice I've seen here has said rehabilitate). They also said if I rehabilitate, I should expect my monthly payment to be quite high because the loan is so old, likely around $500 a month. When I researched online, I got the impression you could rehabilitate on an income based repayment plan, around 15% of discretionary income. The servicer kept telling me to 'name how much I could afford' and that they would take it to my school for approval, but that if I named a low number, I should expect my school to turn it down.  

My AGI is only 23k a year, so I was expecting to be eligible for low payments. Is the advice the servicer is giving accurate? I stepped away from the call and said I would look into my options and call back. Anyone have advice to give? Should I consolidate instead?

&#x200B;

\- Is it true that all my payments up to now have only been targeting principal across the board?

\- When a loan principal is complete and I still ""pay all loans"" option, does it start to pay off the interest for the loan, or will it only do that when all principal for all loans is complete?

\- Once principal is paid for a loan, will the interest already accrued start to accrue interest itself?

\- Is it better to ""close single loans"" by getting rid of principal/interest at the same time, or is it safe for the loan to stay ""open"" with interest sitting (if it doesn't accrue interest itself) and target other loans?

mpfg6d,Are rehabilitation payments considered late?,"GF and I both had Perkins loans which we rehabilitated beginning in 2019, completing in 2020. Between the two of us, on 5/6 credit reports those 9 rehab payments are not shown at all, with ""on time"" payments being reported once the rehab was completed. However looking at her TransUnion report those nine rehab payments (plus one extra for good measure) are shown as ""120+ days late"". Obviously those have a big impact on her TransUnion score, which is about 90 points lower than the others. Of course Perkins info is hard to find now, and fractionated (our alma mater has no information publicly available on this). Question; should those nine (plus one) rehab payments be classified as ""late""? *Can* they be classified as late? Should we dispute or just be thankful that this only shows up in one place?

- studio sessions - my school is in an artsy town and has mainly upper middle class students attending (I'm lower middle), so I'd charge like $100 per hour and it wouldn't be a dent in their wallet.

- etsy selling hiphop items/things I make in graphic design, and then promoting them via tiktok (I might use something like jarvee to grow my account)

-crowdfund on gofundme via tiktok? (a lot of creators were able to net a few k's off a viral video)

- (if I can outsource from taobao before I attend school), dropship on Poshmark or sell to college students locally and personally, a quality Canada goose jacket there only costs $35 + shipping, I can easily resell for 5x that price (downside is shipping time is approx a month, not the fastest)

With current job situation after I complete my master it will likely take 6 month to 2 year to get a grad scheme.I have already received the letter saying that replacement have stated for the master loan( nothing mentioned for the bachelor one) so it like be 3 year into my loan repayment time before I am in full time job. 
Jobs I applying for are between 19k-28k. So let go in the middle and say I will earn £23.5 for the first 3 year of the job. 
I am 6 out of the 30 year now and not a single penny paid for my students loan.
At this point I would need to be paying off 2k a year which would be earning 55k year based on 9% of income past 25k
Hahaha that's not happening.
But how close would I get let say I get average mechanical engineering wage of 35k and that the average engineers wage will not changed in 5 year time
Let be optimised now and say I will be getting 2.2 pay rise rise a year so I would be earning £47k a year by 2035. I would have paid off £20k of loan that worth 70k after interest.
If I continue at 2.2 pay rise a year I wouldn't pay off my loan with having only paid off 40k , but after hit senior engineer pay rise would likely be slow down anyway.

She will work at her job up until she goes to her grad school in June (shes making $14 per hour) and will have no income from here on out.

I'm not sure what the best route will be for her. I've narrowed it down to IBR, Repaye, and paye; though, even after reading posts in this community, I'm not sure what's best financially. It seems like consolidation wont help her interest rate due to the way its weighted and we lose the option of ibr in the future. The program she's going to, she won't have time to work and do school. My question is what strategy will help her have the least monthly billing and lower/stop interest. 

Thanks in advance


Edit: so I just spoke with her and its all in her name. When she was in school the interest was still going, she has been in school for a significant amount of time. I want to thank everyone for suggesting what to do after, but we have already decided to go private sector in our area 1) because the pay is significantly better than public here and a cost analysis shows itll be knocked out much quicker.  2) majority of those people who do the those federal programs are still left owing 99% of the time. With that said just trying to figure out what's the best way to stop the interst occuring while she is in school, that's really all I'm trying to figure out. Thanks guys and girls

moy7kj,Stressed About Student Loan Debt,"I am really stressed about my student loan debt. I have two federal student loans. The first is from grad school (masters program) which is a direct subsidized consolidation loan. The principal balance is $69K. The second is a direct unsubsidized consolidation loan from law school. The principal balance is $276K. Then there is $65K of interest that has accrued since I completed school. In total I owe approximately $410K.

I have been on income based repayment since graduating in 2011. But I consolidated in 2014 to get all my loans with one servicer (Fedloan). The consolidation disbursement date was 8/2014.  According to Fedloan under loan details it states that my expected payoff date is 2036. Is that my payoff date when I get hit with tax bomb? The math just doesn't add up between the interest that has accrued and the number of months that Fedloan states I will be repaying (211 months). Am I missing something here? 211 months is 17.5 years and 2014 to 2036 is 22 years. Is the number of payments calculated from the date I signed up for IBR or the date I consolidated? Even the interest accrued doesn't make sense. I calculate interest accruing at $21K a year based on a rate of 6.35%. Based on my calculations my balance will have ballooned to $750K.

I have tried using [vin.com](https://vin.com) to calculate the amount of forgiveness and the tax bomb and I get different numbers than what I calculate. I don't know if my repayment term is 20 or 25 years based on what IBR plan I am on. I'm trying to keep the interest from accruing any further once the COVID forbearance ends but I can't afford the 10 year standard repayment or I would get this disaster behind me.

A bit of backstory.
I’m 27 and have been a RN for the last 2.5years. It’ll be 3 years by December of this year. I have roughly $68k of student loan debt. I also have a 5 year old and recently separated from her father due to not being able to tolerate his narcissistic abuse any longer. So that cut ties with him and his family for assistance with our daughter. Ultimately, I relocated across the country to be away from them and obtain a fresh start to life. 

My previous jobs were always somewhere between $40-barely hitting $50k in inpatient 3-4 random days a week working 12-14h shifts. My new job is roughly $85k and 9-6pm outpatient clinic. I made sure not to work weekends or holidays since I’m a single parent now. I also own a rental property that I’m able to profit roughly $150 a month.

mosnez,Finally paid off my loan! (UK),"So i've been on here for a long while now, but I finally got to make this post and i'm free!!

Here in the UK the loans work differently to the US where you don't repay anything until earning over £27k Per year and the loans get wiped off after 30 years. The government will take 9% of anything you earn over £27k so it's like paying an extra tax for a whole 30 years so pretty painful as a high earner 

But here's the catch if you have a small enough loan and you earn closer to 50k a year in some cases you may end up paying back more than you owe through your wages during the 30 year period 

My loan was around £21k in total and I worked out including the interest I'd end up paying over 50% more in my wages so it just made sense to pay it off as soon as humanly possible to the interest on the loan didn't start adding up plus I didn't like the idea of 9% being taken from me on every paycheck for years 

Strategy has basically been throw anything I earn at the loan outside of my monthly living costs which has taken me around 2 Years and 7 month in total to pay the whole thing off until today 

I got hit pretty hard in my industry when March hit last year and all my work basically dried up within a week which is pretty tough so it set me back a good 5/6 months of payments I would have otherwise been paying

Luckily I decided to start a business from September last year which has been growing nicely ever since so I suppose something good came out of last year through all the bad stuff 

I can't begin to explain how nice it feels to finally be able to not have to pay any spare money i've got at this thing from now on!

In 2019 I left that job which I hated, but went into a preferred career field making $35k (~1900/mo). Still live at home which sucks, but I’ve been job hunting in same field but diff company bc I know I gotta make more money to survive.

I’ve got maybe another $1700 in Credit card debt but have recently gotten my tax return, stimulus and half of my months pay.

BU is giving me a really good amount of money, enough where I don’t need to take out any loans. Meanwhile, my net cost for USC is around 13k, where I would have to take out 5.5k in federal loans.

The thing about this is... I just prefer USC over BU for a number of reasons. For example, it’s closer to home and I feel as though I’d feel more “at home” there because the culture and diversity are pretty similar.

-focus on bilingualism and cleft palates (which I’m the most interested in) 
-Labs that focus on dysphasia, cerebral palsy, etc (which I’m also very interested in). 
-in New York 
-Ivy League (I know this doesn’t matter in our field BUT the most high ranking cleft palate CFY in the country who only hires 3 students, hired 2 from them)

mo4qv5,Paid off my first loan last night!,"Total starting balance: $189k spread across six federal loans.

Current balance: $156k

And as of last night, my first loan for ~$33,000 with an interest rate of 7.6% is now paid off!

Graduated law school in May of 2019, passed the bar that summer, and secured a job for as soon as I was sworn in (January 2020).  Until then, I was broke and being supported by my wife with a bit of help from my parents, and for that I'm very grateful.  I was making only minimum payments on IBR up until I started my job.  Then, obviously, COVID hit, and I was lucky enough to be able to keep my job and work from home for the entire pandemic, which was really rough as a new attorney, but I'm also grateful for that.  I've really lucked out.

My goal coming out of law school was to continue to live like a student, which I think I've done a good job with.  My living expenses in 2020 were probably $20k or less.  Every extra dime that I didn't slowly set aside for savings went to loans.

The interest waiver on federal loans has been a godsend.  I most definitely would not have made this much progress without it.

Relevant income details:

Income last year: $65k

Income this year: $70k base plus bonuses

Monthly housing cost: mortgage is ~$1200 which I split with my wife in a mid-size city.

No kids.

Transportation: ~$200 a month for my car, $60 for insurance, and basically nothing on gas due to working from home.

Other income: I got the full amounts of the COVID relief checks.  Got married way cheaper than expected because of cutting down our guest list to only family and wedding party because of the pandemic, but people still sent us generous gifts which was a huge boost to savings.  Also had an unexpected windfall of about $5,000 last year.

I contribute 6% of my salary to my 401k for the employer match and maintain $10,000 in savings, a goal which I just recently reached.

Relatively low cost of living city, and I'm very frugal with student loans in mind at all times.

My goal from here is to pay $2,000 a month until the end of the interest waiver to get the balance down to about $146k, which is stretching my budget pretty thin but is definitely worth it to me.  Once the waiver ends, I'm planning to refi most of my loans to private over 15 years to give myself some wiggle room in my budget, drop my interest to hopefully around 3.7%.  The goal is to have a manageable payment so that we can afford to have kids, go on vacation, save a bit more more for retirement, etc.  Thinking that I will leave $40k federal just in case some level of forgiveness ends up happening.

The differences that I can see: I'd have to consolidate to enroll in PAYE, IBR is easier to qualify for, IBR no cap on unpaid interest vs PAYE which has a cap on unpaid interest.

1. Does it matter which repayment plan I choose? Are there certain differences in how interest is treated?

mmkhqu,"1st Semester Junior, $65,000 in debt","I am currently a junior in California and am getting a degree in biology. I have multiple Parent Plus loans that add up to $65,000. I checked the interest rates for these loans and they’re about 7.1%. I still have 3 more semesters to finish and I’ll probably be close to $100,000 in debt through parent plus loans. 
 
I took a semester off in the fall of 2019 and I’m assuming I fell out of the grace period (someone on this subreddit explained this situation, which I also am in) and have begun the repayment period. Another loan is also in repayment, all together around $40,000 that I already have to repay. The problem is I don’t have income and live at home. The biggest loan is already in repayment but I don’t think I can start making payments as soon as the payments are required again. I’m assuming I’m not paying right now because of COVID.

&#x200B;

AES (American Educational Services) services my loan for SunTrust, the holder of the loan. (Neither of which I had any choice in)

Both of my loans are federal loans, as confirmed by AES.

AES claims that it doesn't know anything and it's up to my bank, SunTrust, to decide whether it continues charging interest or extends the forbearance.

Last year, I had to call in order to get my loan forbearance extended to this year. Meanwhile, they are still charging interest. This month I called to ask why the loan forbearance wasn't automatically extended to September 2021 and was told by AES that they don't know anything about that, and the best they could do was give me another month.

What is going on here? Does an executive order from the president carry the force of law, or is just a strong suggestion to the banks handling student loans? How can AES not know anything about an executive order which directly affects them and everything they do.

Any help here is appreciated.

mm1lpc,Just paid off my private loan of $28322!,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Just wanted to share that I finished paying off my private loan of $28322 since the start of the Pandemic last year. Want to mention up front that my apartment least ended in June 2020 and I had the option to move back with family so that I could aggressively pay off this loan, about $2000 per month. I also threw what would have been my last month of rent in May 2020 since had already paid it, my security deposit, and every stimulus check that I received ($3200). Was definitely a difficult decision to move back with parents but now that I'm at the end I'm happy I did it and thankful I had the option.

For reference, 28 y/o male with a bachelors degree, Salary: $54500 and after taxes/benefit deductions I earn about $2900/month. I usually put $400 in my biweekly paycheck into my checking and put everything else into my reserve account until I'm ready to make a payment. 

&#x200B;

At the start of the pandemic I was sitting around $100,000 in loans just from my undergrad, and now am looking at little under $70,000. By September, I plan to have my remaining loans around $55,000 which are all federal at this point. By September I should be able to refinance one of my loans to a private where the payments are only about $60/month if I push it out to 20 years, which I am more than happy to do as it earns me more financial freedom. The last loan is on income base repayment so I'll handle that when the time comes. I got a different job where my salary increased between the lat time I filed for IBR so no idea what my monthly payment will be at this point. 

Praying for some student loan relief via government but I'm thankful I've been able to start handling the problem on my own. I wish everyone the best in their efforts to pay down their debt and hope you see relief from it soon.",55,312,StudentLoans,1825

• I do want to try and get a car- looking at a 5k down-payment on a 10k-15k car and finance the rest (cheaper if I can).

Right now I'm averaging 2k a month after taxes with a loan payment of about 1900 a month.

I know I need to pivot and change industries as I'll never be able to make enough to afford them. The loans I'm talking about are all private I have about another 30k in federal loans but those, luckily I haven't had to start paying yet and once I do they will just end up defaulting as it's impossible to afford new bills. I'll never be able to afford a new car, a house, or a family. It seems like I've thrown away life based off a decision I made when I was young, dumb, and 18.

I’m currently making payments on my loans while they’re in the 0% period and I’m not quite sure how exactly each billing option will effect my payments after the interest kicks in again. 

Here is what the say for options: 

“You made a payment that is equal to or more than the amount of future monthly payments – do you want to be billed for your full Monthly Payment Amount? (Note: We’ll always apply your Overpayment toward your Current Balance.)

The Billing Direction assumes that payments you have scheduled are going to post to your account.

Billing Direction
•No, Advance my due date by the number of payments I cover. Even if you have zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total cost of borrowing.

•Yes, Bill me for my full monthly payment. You will be required to make a full monthly payment with your next billing statement.”
 
Does it really matter which one I choose? My understanding is that the advance due date only a little better because then I wouldn’t necessarily have a payment due but the interest will still accrue so I really should be making payments anyway, right?

mkbdvp,Question about the term of repayment on a FFEL student loan disbursed in 2005.,"Through a variety of means, all legal of course, I've successfully avoided paying any actual money on my student loans for sixteen years after graduation.  I've been on an IBR program for three years now, with a monthly payment of $0 on a balance of $63,000 at 2.8%.

Due to circumstances beyond my control my AGI for 2020 was $58,000 and thus I most likely will not be able to remain at $0 payment after this year's IBR is renewed.  

I was wondering what the term (loan repayment time) would be if I simply allowed IBR to expire and went back to the ""standard repayment"" plan.  I read that the term is usually ten (10) years, but wouldn't that have run in 2015?  These loans are from 2001-2005.  Or does that time I spent in forbearance, IBR, etc. toll the repayment time?  Or does that ten years start from the day I go back on standard repayment?  If I stayed in IBR with an AGI of $58,000 would the term remain at twenty-five years?  I'm totally lost.

EDIT: I remember from the paperwork I received in 2005 that my original term was for thirty (30) years.  Could this be true?  If so, does this mean it's been thirty years this whole time, through all the non-payment, forbearance, hardships, IBR, etc.?

I did find this, https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/standard  plus I just checked online and I do have an FFEL Direct Consolidation loan.  Disbursal Date 7/2005, Estimated Payoff Date 10/2032.  So I guess all this time of not paying anything and the thirty years just kept on ticking by?

It looks pretty legit.  So if I had a ten year original term, then the time would have run out already and I would have defaulted in 2015?",4,1,StudentLoans,1655

I am still wearing the same clothes, some clothes look a bit washed up. i only work and go home, some days ill meet up with friends/family or go to do outdoor activities. they also worry because im doing so much OT and they think i dont need all that OT, and are scared that i might crash and end up in the hospital. what they dont understand is that i love my job, therefore doing OT doesnt exhaust me. my job is not physically nor mentally draining, so doing OT is nothing! i dont care about buying new clothes because thanks to this pandemic, i cant go out to fancy places so whats the use?

mj0i7g,Experience with lawyer loan negotiations,"Hey, I have Navient student loans (all private unfortunately so im not sure how much biden's plans will help me) They are about 93k as of today (Some federal loans have been paid off.) Unfortunately, I have had a difficult time finding a worthwhile job after college, and now on disability. My dad has been helping with the bills but Navient keeps increasing our payments beyond what we (specifically he) can afford. We have paid over 100k with approx $500 or more a month for the last 12 years, yet my current balance is 14k more than what it started. I guess its all going to interest, but we can't even afford that. Because he is a cosigner, I'm not sure if i can get the disability relief, though I'm going to try.   


But it is impossible for us to get ahead with this. and since they keep increasing our rates, the difference between what he can pay and what they want ends up collecting more and more fees, and we get harassed constantly, and of course it affects our otherwise good credit, thus reducing our ability to refinance.   


I talked to a lawyer, and of course he can't make any guarantee as to the amount they can reduce, though said they've gotten total payment down up to 50% for some people, but that was with a lump sum payback offer. They'd charge me $6k with no guarantee of how much they could get for me. Even a set figure (pay back X more) and that's it, would be better then this interest based system with no end in sight.  If they could drop our total payback by that $6k or more, and come up with a better payment plan to something we could better afford, it'd be a no brainer to go with them, but not knowing for sure, or even a ball park what they can do, its a hard number to risk when we have little income to waste.

So, I was mainly wondering what happens if I do end up needing only just $70,000. Does the remaining $20,000 accrue interest even if I never take it? Is there any penalty for applying for it but not using it? Could it have any adverse impact on the repayment term/monthly payment/any other facets of the loan? Basically, the main question is, is there any disadvantage or possible issue in taking this extra amount to account for unexpected difficulties? If I end up not using that extra $20,000 or so, will it be an issue in any way? I looked through Earnest's terms a lot but couldn't find anything about this.",9,0,StudentLoans,1205

More Klain on student debt: Biden will ""look at that legal authority"" in said memo, ""he’ll look at policy issues around that, and then he’ll make a decision.""

mhqub5,Why should I pay my student loan?,"With a $70K salary I'm supposed to raise kids, get a mortgage, car and be happy? The whole purpose of this loan was to actually increase my salary. If this failed - the loaner should be the one responsible, because they gave me the  money. They have the means to calculate if my degree will actually give me a good salary. Instead they are protected from default. Not fair. And just paying my student loan I'm actually losing money and not living at all.

On another hand, I can pay only the loan % and something small, say 25$ per month and aim for at least 100$ per month in savings. Now these savings I use to make money. Say, buy stocks (like the ARK ETF for example).

1) my student loan is at 5.3% and if I make even 5.4% at least per year using these savings, I'm actually making money, not losing.

2) my student loan on my credit score - is used to calculate my whole debt. The more debt I have and with regular payments, and monthly minimum payment - this will actually increase my credit score and will allow me to take more loans and use them to make more money.

Even if I take lots of loans, if I manage to pay the required minimum payment and I'm gaining even a 0.
1% more per year - I'm actually making money, not losing them. So my student loan is actually helping me get rich by giving me a credit score power.

What am I missing ?


==============
UPDATE:
regarding the question that ""they entrusted me the money and I refuse to pay?"" - I agree, this is probably a correct question and a tough one. But allow me please to refraim this question so that it falls more in line with the real situation.

A group of experts in money management, risk management and human resources with a bunch of automated algorithms and programs to assess my request and a database of thousands of demands like mine, received my request to take their money in exchange for a certain percentage in order for me to buy a college degree. They are experts in calculating the risks, assessing the probability of my salary, know the current mortage and spending levels, are aware about market risks, annual inflation, have algorithms to assess my human psychology and consequently to calculate the probability that I will have a job based on the degree that I receive. Nevertheless, these people have 0 (zero) risk with their money since their money are backed by the state. On the other hand, I risk several years of my life, believing that a degree will increase my salary.

Compounded by the fact that now I received the money and I'm already biased on spending them on a college degree, I am searching for a degree based on some of my own priorities like some BS story of - ""I want to do something that I love doing"". The college is well aware about what degree they are selling, they know the probability of me having a good job, they know about the loan, they know that I'm biased to buy what they are selling me, and yet they have absolutely no obligation regarding the quality of that degree.

Basically, a group of experts in education sold me a stock that is worth nothing (the so-called degree) - worth nothing because the market pays nothing for it (officially called salary), these experts (the college) have no obligation whatsoever regarding their stock (the degree), the college takes the money from another group of experts (the loaning company), to pay the fake stock (the degree), and now the governemnt obliges me to do anything that I can just to repay those money that were used for buying a fake stock using a salary that is not in line with today's market conditions and a salary that is diminishing every year due to inflation while the loan percentage stays the same ?

HM ..... the game is rigged. How about we change the rules: say they loan me money, but if I don't get the required salary - I have no obligation to pay them back. This small change automatically brings a risk level to the loaning company, doesn't it ? With this new risk - will they still give me that loan ? I don't think so. Without the loan, the college will not sell a fake degree. If there is no demand for a degree, the college will be obliged to change the degrees they are selling. And THAT my friend - is the true ""demand - based"" market.

Now - ask me again your question - do I want to pay my student loan ? :) NO, I don't. The truth is that I was deceived. Two groups of experts sold me a fake stock (a degree), that is worth nothing, and just took advantage of the fact that I didn't know what I am buying. Thank you Daniel Kahnehman, Robert Cialdini and Dan Ariely for opening my eyes about psychological manipulation. I am the victim here and I have no obligation to pay their loan. I did my part - I studied hard, and got the degree. On the other hand - the college, the loaning company and the government - deceived me. Of course I will pay that student loan because today the Governement is protecting the con-man. But I will pay it on my terms, say in 50 years, (provided there are no changes in percentage).",15,0,StudentLoans,5017

I am married, husband has salary paying job at $80k.

I have 200k in FedLoans with 20k outstanding interest in limbo w/ COVID. I never consolidated. There are around 14 loans with interest rates ranging from 5-8% when active.

We are early 30's, just bought our first house this year (1.6k a month mortgage), 70k in savings (plus our 401ks). No kids. We both come from low-income, struggling families and are completely self-made (hence the significant debt). I say this because I keep hoarding money in savings as a safety net. I need a financial planner (I know this) but I get very anxious to avoid living paycheck to paycheck, which is why the 70k hasn't been applied towards loans. 

So with all that being said, my main question is: given that I'm commission (i.e. not a stable salary) do I refinance my loans and consolidate for a lower interest rate? Should I just hustle down my debt with the government and have the safety net if I cannot make payments? Should I stop putting so much in savings and start throwing it at the loans?

I don't know if I'll get merit scholarships yet or if there is any more need-based aid. I have a credit card and am still establishing a credit score, but I should have a score in August. 

**QUESTIONS:**

Where should I take out loans if I can't afford school?

Can I take out a loan with a student credit card (I have Chase Freedom Student)?

Has anyone appealed their financial aid decision to get more money?

Should I look into the Parent Plus Loan if I can convince my mother (I would be paying it back)? The interest rate would be 5.30% after I graduate.

Should I start repaying the unsubsidized loans during my PhD program before there is interest? I plan on attending a school with a $30,000/year stipend (I probably will only have around $8,000 for my own expenses) and working part-time, should I try and pay off the unsubsidized loans first before the interest rates begin?

Is there a way to forgive/reduce some of my loans if I have low-income once the grace period ends?

It says my first payment is due in 2026, but I won't graduate from my PhD program until 2028, what does this mean? Do I have to start paying in 2026? Or will it change once I am enrolled in an institution?

mgkibw,Huge announcement from the ED regarding defaulted FFEL loans/COVID,"The ED just announced they are extending the covid waivers to defaulted commercially held FFEL.  This means zero percent interest backdated to March 13th, all involuntary payments refunded and voluntary payments having the option of being refunded.

It also means anyone who defaulted on a commercial FFEL (which is most FFEL) after March 13th will have their loan placed back in good standing.  Hypothetically, once the loan is back in good standing you would no longer get the zero percent interest but see my comment below.

If you were pursuing rehab and missed a rehab payment during the covid period, that month would still count for rehab (which matters to those who defaulted prior to March 13th)

here's the presser https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USED/bulletins/2ca3aaa

there will be more info on thursday 

Now - to address the elephant in the room - for those borrowers of FFEL in good standing - there was no discussion of also extending the waivers to them - however they did hint that they are working on something.  So if you have the bright idea to default to get the zero percent interest don't do it - one - you don't have enough time to default before the waivers end and two - they MAY be working to extend this further so just sit tight and keep your fingers crossed.",48,111,StudentLoans,1299

mg4bex,"UPDATE: Debt from a cosigned loan, other I didn't cosign","A quickie, I made a post in Feb about a loan (well there are two now) that one I cosigned but the other I did not.  The advice was to dispute and send them a form from the debt rights site, which I did.  These guys are called MRS BPO in NJ.  I sent them a three page dispute asking for validity, proof of payments, statute of limitations, and the right to even collect a debt from another state.

Well they responded, came in the mail today, and I'm a bit pissed.

1. One of the things I asked for was proof of transactions and by whom.  Apparently they gave me a sheet of ""transactions"" from 06 all the way to last month!  Yet they did not disclose WHO made the payments, or where they came from or if these are ""fees"" tacked up.  My in law who I cosigned one of the loans for has no clue was was giving me one sentence answers.  His wages were garnished and I wonder if this was the garnishment or them making up fees to make it look like payments?  There's no paper trail, just their ""proof"".
2. No promissory note.  This is a big one, instead it's a scan of the check the bank sent over front and back, one of them has my sisters signature along with my in law and what was supposed to pass off as mine.  AFAIK without the prom note they can't collect.  The application was also missing from what I requested.  I also asked them to identify the primary signer, they did not do that either.
3. Lack of settlement, while I did not admit that the debt is mine I did request a settlement in case, they did not include one.
4. They did not explain the added fees or interest, or specify the last billing statement.
5. They also did not answer if they are licensed to collect from my state since they are based in NJ.

I'm also mad that I can't get my in law to even check what was all in his garnishments, he doesn't care.  They were living in their truck for years while the garnishments were active.  My sister is a dullard who's a stay at home wife who can't keep a story straight so I can't rely on her either.

I did call a lawyer up and he kept bringing the statute of limitations up.  Thing is, that sheet of the dates and random amounts, I don't know if they were payments or the agencies tacking on random fees to balloon the amount?  They did not disclose anything.

So now I have to make yet another letter, disputing that they do not have all the information I've asked for and that unless they do everything I've asked for to the last request, they have no means to collect from me.  I may even ask for my brother in law's contact info as proof since even I don't have that info in case something were to happen to my sister in an emergency.

I also just checked my credit report, not a trace of them even looking into me.",4,4,StudentLoans,2734

I’ve already been though this shit with my parents when I was first applying for undergrad, and I was telling my parents we need to fill it out and their response was “no, we make too much money and you won’t have get anything, so I don’t want to waste my time” which yes they do make a comfortable salary, but I feel like even if I filled it out I’d at least get a mf $1 from the FASFA....anyways now we back in this same situation and same answer from them.....I did get merit based scholarships but I feel like I could bring my cost down a bit if they would just help me fill it out. (I know it won’t be a lot bc I didn’t apply in October). So anyways, I’m not sure how to approach it because they want me to get a lot of scholarship money and even to me not to claim them as a dependent so I can get more money, and I’ve argued with them several times explaining it doesn’t work like that and I have to be 24.....I’m not sure if it’s because my parents are immigrants so they don’t really understand how the US educational system works, or is because they are mad from when my older brother applied and apparently “he didn’t get anything”.

The issue i'm having is that my loans were previously consolidated as part of a part of a Direct Lending Program that's no longer around (FFEL), which means they aren't eligible for consolidation under the current programs unless I take on additional student loan debt. Once i do, my understanding is I will be eligible to consolidate them and bring my interest rate down since it's an average of the new loan and the rates I already have.

The last thing i need is more SL debt, but if that's the only workaround, then so be it.  What programs are out there that are relatively low cost that might qualify? Are there certificate programs that would be beneficial to me? Management or Leadership programs for example that i can use student loans to finance the cost?  Has anyone done this before?

Here's how we did it. When my wife and I got married in July 2019, we had $80K in debt and an interest rate of 6.74%. With that interest rate, our minimum monthly payment was barely shaving off a few dollars from the loan principle. We compared rates with dozens of companies, and decided to go with Earnest, who offered us a rate of 3.45%, almost half the rate we were paying before. With our new interest rate, our minimum payment dropped dramatically and we were saving $400/month in interest payments alone. We took the savings and any extra money we could earn and began to aggressively pay off our debt. We stayed committed to our goal, and 21 months later, we are debt free!

&#x200B;

Edit: apparently I should clarify that I have no connection to Earnest. I just recommend them because they offered us the best rates and they never gave me a problem. If another company gives you better rates, go with them.

My idea is to take $4000 I should have saved up by the end of September, take $2000 of that to knock out the unpaid interest of my loan with the highest interest rate. Then just leave the other $2000 in that account and let the gains keep coming in. Then before the year is up, I take all of the gains, let's say it's a few hundred, and throw that into the loan as an extra payment, and just keep repeating it. 

Or should I try to build up $5k, which would be just about the accrued interest for all my loans, knock that out completely, and pay the $500 a month which should be enough to cover the interest both loan accrue during a month (I calculated it's about $300) and the extra would go toward the principal to ideally to the loan with the higher interest rate first.",4,0,StudentLoans,1264

I am wondering how to tackle my student loans + buy a house next year. Here's the backstory - I have about $25k federal student loans currently frozen by the gov. I paid off all my CC debt (about $17k) over the past year, plus I paid off my car, and I have savings  for a home. I live in a relatively low-cost of living area but still think the home prices are overinflated. Waiting for prices to cool off. I can wait it out. 

I hope to get a mortgage in the next year-ish. Should I pay off my student loans, or let them sit on my credit? Current credit score is 806 Excellent. I was going to start debt snowballing my loans like I did for my consumer debt, but that would close the accounts and possibly cause my credit score to go down. Instead I'm saving in a 'high yield' account to make a lump-sum payment in September when the freeze ends. 

**I WANT to see my student loan balance go down (and for the peace of mind), but I don't want to lose my 806 credit score because I hope to get a mortgage within the next 18 months. Anybody ever been in a situation like this? Should I buy the house, and then pay off the loans in a lump-sum?** I am going to continue sending money to a savings account until the freeze is up so I do have time to decide what I wanna do.

* salary: \~$70k
* age: 20 somethin' 
* debt: public student loans of $25k
* credit score: 806
* no cc debt, no car debt (available credit is $36k)

mdts0e,Student loans half paid off- a long journey!,"Hi all! 31F. 

Love reading your advice on here, I wish I had known about this earlier as a first generation college student. I had no financial help during college and really had to figure out the loan process as a pretty naive, but hardworking 20 year old. (I paid for 2 years of community college out of pocket). My mom always said “get a degree so you don’t struggle like your dad and I have”. But navigating this wasn’t easy without any guidance from anyone. 

 I finished grad school in 2015 with 40k in fed loans (17k from undergrad, 23k from grad school). I worked full-time throughout all of college, so paid as much as I could out of pocket- super stressful, but worth it. I didn’t make much, but enough to pay for my living expenses (split with my husband) and books. 

After graduation, I pretty much just paid the interest each month with the IBR- but the last 2.5 years I got really serious about paying down my debt with a slight increase in salary. My loans are NOW at 20k. I know I have still a ways to go, but since these loans have literally been haunting me since Dec 2011 (when I finished undergrad), I’m just so grateful to have made it this far.

Keep chugging along! Nothing feels as good as watching that number drop every month. I have a 9 month old son and I NEVER want him to go through the stress of student loans. I am proud of my education, but the “typical American student loan process” is such a mess. Worth it? I guess so because I’m FINALLY working at a job I love.

Now just imagine you continue to make roughly 60,000-70,000 a year for 10 years. Awesome. You're able to get whatever reminder after 10 years forgiven

Here's the catch...if you have a job that increases your salary every year, imagine making 80-100k within 5 years (police officers and firefighters have these increases) now your student loan monthly payment under your income repayment plan since it generates from your W2 you will be paying about $650 a month for the next 5 years after

When you calculate all this, did you really forgive anything? No because by year 8 you would've finished everything, and you paid way more than your standard. If your standard loan was about $520 a month then you're better off just doing that for 10 years.

So in reality PSLF didn't forgive shit. You just paid more.

This really only works if your student debt is 100k+ and you make roughtly around 50-60k a year only. That's it. Anything over? Forget it. It's completely pointless.

>The grand total: $70.3 billion.  
>  
>To be specific, that’s how much the government collected on its loan portfolio in financial year 2019, the last full year before payments were paused due to the pandemic. It covers only payments on loans that are owned and managed by the government, which currently total about $1.4 trillion, according to the Department of Education’s latest portfolio summary. It doesn’t count payments on the $160 billion worth of outstanding loans that are government backed but owned by private lenders, which were made under the old federal student loan program that was discontinued after 2010. Nor does it cover private debt.

It's so infuriating.  To be clear I don't even \*have\* student loan debt.  I dropped out of school at 14 and enlisted the week I turned 18.

Why in the heck is there a government ""profit\*"" motive attached to educating its citizens?  The benefit to a society from having an educated populous is in ***having an educated populous***.

I asked if I'd get charged any fees for this outstanding $20, and they said no as fees are only charged for late loan payments, and I already made my loan payment that's due for April.

mck8s1,Anyone seen a Refi Estimator with Debt to Income modifier?,"I'm currently with SoFi, variable interest rate, $48,000 balance roughly. My parents might be willing to do a private (between us, not reporting to credit bureaus) loan for $20,000 so I can refinance and qualify for a lower interest rate. I called SoFi to discuss this, and they told me they cannot estimate a refi rate with a different debt to income ratio. When I calculate a refi rate for $48,000 (15 years), I get around 4.9%, and for $28,000 I get around 5.0%. I want to calculate my rate based on a lower debt to income ratio, but their system is automatic and won't let them edit the DTI to see a new rate.

My question:

Does anyone know of an online calculator to estimate interest rates I qualify for with a lower DTI, OR, does anyone know of a lender who will estimate (I know they can't commit to it) a refi rate based on a hypothetical, lower DTI?

mcgrn6,I desperately need help. I'm terrified and don't know what to do. Sallie Mae has wrecked my life.,"At 18, as a first gen college student who was determined to graduate and be out on my own, I borrowed a shit ton of private student loan money from Sallie Mae. My father cosigned on it, just as uneducated on the student loan process as I was. There's 6 or 7 loans in total ranging from 8.25-12% interest, which I didn't realize would absolutely obliterate me at the time. 

I finished undergrad and went onto grad school, that was paid for with Federal student loans (4-6% interest), for which I did not require a cosigner. I was employed full-time throughout both my undergrad and graduate years, but due to being out on my own and funding all my own expenses, I don't have much in savings -- maybe 8 grand. 

I finished my MBA last year and the roughly 10k in federal loans I have are delayed to September (thanks 'Rona.) Sallie came to collect my private ones (for which I now owe nearly $188k in debt) this month. After telling them I was unable to make a $2150/mo payment to keep my account current, I called them to see what my options are. They told me they best they could offer me was 12 months of interest-only payments, which totalled $1600 a month. I cannot sustain that. 

I have been looking for weeks at refinancing my private loans, and after getting rejected (even with a cosigner) from almost all of them, I was approved for a refi at a rate of 4.9% and a monthly payment of $1250 -- which is better, but still wildly uncomfortable for me. I have yet to sign the loan offer. I reached out to them asking if there was any way we could renegotiate to get me a lower monthly payment, but I feel sick to my stomach and have been in and out of anxiety attacks for days now because I literally do not know what to do. 

FWIW, I have a credit score of 707, take home \~3650 a month. After living expenses (rent, utilities, internet, car payment) I'm left with $1531. If I take this refi option, which feels like the *only* option for me at this point, I'll be left with just about $280 per month. I don't even know what I'll do when my federal loan payments kick in. 

I'm already going to try to get a roommate to cut down on expenses, but I'm locked into my housing situation for the forseeable future. I don't want to do this to myself -- but I don't know what else to do. I feel so sick and stupid and helpless.

EDIT: 
hi sorry for the vagueness. Including more detail here. 
Yes I did recently finish my MBA, and I am employed with a company I’ve been with for the last two years. I recently got a promotion (literally this month) which took my income from $60k to $65k, so I likely won’t be up for a raise until at least end of the year. 

I have 30 days to accept my refinance offer and intend to do so, however the final offer from Earnest was $1275 a month at 5.08%, not the original 1250 @ 4.9%, but it’s still my best option. 

With that said, my expenses breakdown like so: 
My monthly take home after taxes &amp; benefits: $3712 
Less rent: 1650 
Less car payment: 170 
Less Car insurance: 85
Less savings auto transfer: 100

I’m trying to find a way to finance an accelerated second bachelor’s degree in nursing.

I bought it for $55k in a rough neighborhood that has changed a lot in the last decade). If it’s relevant, my overall GPA is 3.9 and my math and science GPA is 4.0. The tuition for the program that accepted me is 55k. The school offers no financial aid and FAFSA is only offering $12.5k in loans.  

I really thought I was in good shape for getting a loan, but I’ve been rejected by both College Ave (for a student loan) and PNC Bank (where I tried to get a home equity loan). Both stated that my income level is too low as the sole reason for rejection. This is frustrating, because clearly the point of returning to school for a career-focused degree is to increase income and I’ve demonstrated clearly that I’m responsible to a fault. In the last two years I’ve been employed full time as an intern at a cancer research facility ($8/hr) and then as an EMT ($16/hr) while attending school part-time to fulfill the nursing prerequisites.

mc9vbu,StudentLoans v/s using Home Equity for college,"Hello,

Our kid will be starting college this year. 

Given our current earnings, we don't qualify for any assistance and will have to end up paying \~80K/year for college. Yes, we are aware of cheaper in-state alternatives and this is their preferred college/program and we fully support their decision.

Hopefully by the second year, internships or TA, may help pay for some of the housing and misc expenses.

We have  $30K in a 529 plan, along with $10k in savings account. 

Most of our savings being wiped out due to long term care expenses for immediate family over the last few years, who recently passed away from COVID exposure, so there are no new expenses on that front. 

We have been living lean for the last few years, trying to limit our expenses. Have a savings of \~$500/month based on our current living expenses which we currently use to pay extra towards our home equity line of credit, which we can expand a bit, by cutting down on other expenses like TV and getting rid of the second car which could get our monthly savings \~$800/month. 

My plan was to use the 529 plan & use our savings and pay for the first semester.

We also plan on requesting the college to reconsider their decision based on our financial situation, but are not too hopeful

Do have equity in our home that we can borrow against (\~$120K) for under 3%. This should help pay for \~2 years of college.

mc5zuh,Teacher Forgivness denied again - advice needed.,"TLDR: 5000.00 teacher forgiveness loan is being denied due to “outstanding loan taken before 10/31/1998”. I started my undergrad in 1998. 

Background: I started undergrad in 1998. I had moved out of my parents house and was living on my own. My parents provided no financial assistance to me for college so I took out loans and worked part time to be able to attend and pay for living arrangements. My husband and I were dating at the time and he did the same. We graduated in Dec of 2001 which was terrible timing as we had a difficult time landing jobs. Finally he found employment in another state and we moved. 
We consolidated our loans into 1 to make the payments easier to handle (stupid in hindsight but we had no one to ask advice of as my parents had their schooling paid for and his didn’t attend college). 

We both worked from 2002-2008 in our respective professions, paying on the loan as per the agreement. In 2008 after the birth of our 2nd child I lost my job with a national homebuilder and couldn’t find another (go figure). Our income was cut in half. He had gone back to school for an MBA and I decided to go for a career change since it didn’t look like my industry would come back anytime soon. We had 2 full time jobs (I was hired earlier than expected due to a willingness to teach in a title 1 school, already having a degree and working on a master’s), 2 small children, and we were both back in school. We knew the debt from SL was getting up there but we only took out what we absolutely had to. 

We both graduated and had been paying it back since then. I worked as a teacher for 5 1/2 years in title one schools, enjoyed it but am no longer a teacher. We did not consolidate our graduate loans. He is working on PLFP and I was eligible for the 5000.00 TLF. I filled out the application and submitted it and they sent me a note saying because I had an outstanding loan before Oct 1998 I was not eligible for TLF on my graduate school direct loans. (Remember I started in Sept of 1998). I called and spoke to them arguing that I had barely started school at that time and was told “only the secretary of education could change the date”. Denied because of an “Outstanding” loan. We have been paying on undergrad since 2002 but b/c it’s consolidated we don’t qualify for any type of assistance other than pausing it during 2008 and 2009 while we tried to get back on our feet. We are doing fine now so we decided to get a personal loan in his name to pay it off (better interest rate anyway) so I would be eligible for the TLF. At this point I had paid so much in interest that the “forgiveness would really only cover the compounded interest not principle. 

We did that in January so the old loan to the government is “paid”. I resubmitted my application a few days ago and last night received the denial letter for the same reason. If you read this far (thank you). I’m so frustrated and don’t know what to do from here. I guess because I took out a loan at all for undergrad I’m denied this simple TLF.
I earned it, fulfilled all the requirements and frankly have paid far more in interest payments and have years before both will be paid off. We are also worried about my husband’s PLSP. He qualified and only has another year left. Advice would be appreciated.",7,4,StudentLoans,3296

mbz3db,Master's degree from Oxford worth the investment/student loans?,"Hello fellow redditors, 

Not sure if this is the right place to post, but would appreciate any and all perspectives -- here goes:

I've gotten an admission offer from Oxford for a 1-year MSc program in the social sciences (one of two programs I applied to, both at Oxford, still waiting to hear back for the other one). I'm super excited about it, almost certain that I am going to accept the offer as this one was my first choice - the only thing that is giving me some pause is knowing that I will have to take out around $40k in student loans to afford it, in addition to blowing a big chunk of my cash savings. 

The total cost of attendance including tuition would come out to $60-70k, depending on how frugally I go about the living costs. I won't know for another month or two whether I will have any scholarships from the university, but as an American I am not banking on getting any funding as it is crazy competitive for their master's programs and especially for non-EU or Commonwealth international students. I will also be spending some time in the coming months applying for any other scholarships I can find, but from what I have gleaned so far the opportunities are relatively scant/small dollar, especially for a master's degree abroad. I don't come from any kind of family money, so it pretty much will have to be self-funded.

My motivations for applying and wanting to do this program in the first place is a combination of (1) the academic/social/networking experience I would be getting from the opportunity to study in that prestigious environment for a year, (2) potential for future professional opportunities as a result of having the Oxford ""brand name"" on my resume (though I know this is somewhat more limited for a social sciences degree compared to something like an MBA/finance/engineering degree/etc.), (3) opportunity to live abroad for 1+ year, depending on whether I decide to/am able to find a job in the UK after completing the degree (honestly more for the adventure of it than anything else), and (4) burnout from my current job that pays decently well but that I have grown to kind of hate and generally a desire to step back from the working world for a while and potentially re-orient my career -- I honestly really enjoy school.

A bit of additional personal background/context:

* I graduated from a top 5 US university for undergrad + another humanities master's degree (both from the same university). I don't have any debt from either of those degrees since I come from a low-income background, so I qualified for full financial aid for undergrad and got full funding for the master's program through a combination of need-based and merit-based scholarships + part-time work. Also, already having a fancy degree, I know there is probably less of a potential boost from another fancy degree.
* In general, I don't have any other personal debt. I've been living back with my parents for the last 2.5 years since finishing school, no rent payments and no car payments or anything, so I've been able to save pretty aggressively.
* Have been working for 2 years and currently making a salary of $76k. After the degree, I would plan to pursue career opportunities where I would be making at least that much (my target is to find something in the $80k-$100k range in some kind of consulting or like higher-level government advising roles; I currently work in policy. Though obviously that is not guaranteed). 
* I plan to stay at my current job through June and would be leaving with about $40k in cash savings + \~$35k across Roth IRA/401k/taxable investment accounts + $9-10k across a few checking accounts. My plan would be to use around $30k of the cash savings to cover my living expenses for the year and take out federal student loans to pay for tuition. I'd like to still have some cash at the end of the program to have a cushion for the job search + any family emergencies that might come up (my parents are kind of broke and I always have an underlying worry of needing to step in to help them through financial rough patches). Ideally will not touch any of the investment accounts. 
* I'm not interested in/did not apply to any master's programs in the US (I feel like I've already had that experience + even if I would qualify for more financial aid domestically, tuition is quite a bit higher here so I think the cost would come out somewhat similar). 

I think I am partly seeking validation that I'm not absolutely nuts to be willing to take on that kind of debt (especially in this economy) for what amounts to an expensive escape from feeling trapped/stagnant/unhappy with where I am in life right now (compounded by pandemic burnout), but at the same time hoping that it will be a worthy investment in a big personal growth and learning experience. However, I welcome all perspectives/critiques, especially from any who may have completed master's degrees in the UK/Europe and whether you felt your experience was worth it if it is something that you had to self-fund. 

(And of course, all of this is assuming that COVID is more under control by the fall and there is a high likelihood that the program will be mostly or fully in-person; definitely not going to pay that kind of money for an online degree. We're able to withdraw from the program any time up to when it starts).",13,12,StudentLoans,5341

Monthly Est for standard payment: $1100
Monthly est for PAYE: $300

PAYE Payment: I am thinking about pursuing the PAYE plan which gives me not only a low monthly payment, but also allows me to jump on the PSLF plan if I can land a public job in the future.

My question is, if I decide to go with the standard 10 year payment plan, will I really be saving an exorbitant amount on interest considering that I'll be making extra payments every month to pay it off? Or would sticking to the PAYE plan be more beneficial even though it'll take longer and there's a tax bomb at the end?

mbgz10,Royal Mistake on one of my loans. Need help,"I have a private loan through THECB. I mistakenly thought it was in deferral due to the pandemic but it was just a 6 month grace period. I missed 90 days of payments and it went into delinquency. I had not updated the address recently and the mail (only form of communication for them) was going to that house. A quick check on my credit and it got absolutely rocked. I had perfect status on all of my accounts before this and now I am feeling royally f'd, going from a 770 to a 620. 

I called the loaner and they said there is nothing they can / will do to update the late status of those payments not even a letter of goodwill would help. What is the next best thing for me to do? I have disputed it but I don't know if it will do any good given it is accurate just an honest mistake. And I explained that to them when filing the dispute. I have been saving exactly for this loan and can pay it off in full (I could have before it went late i just wasn't aware, but that's my fault). Should I pay it off in full or pay excess payments to use it to build my credit back up.

how long might it take to get that score back to where it was?",2,3,StudentLoans,1139

Does anyone know if it is possible?

Addendum:
I have now talked to Laurel Road and Earnest.

For Laurel Road the answer is yes.  If you want to maintain separate accounts, you can maintain separate accounts, you just have to specify that you do not want to consolidate in the contract before you sign the final documentation.  You will get one account number but individual ""series"" numbers for each of the loans and you can concentrate additional payments to one loan at a time.

For Earnest the answer is ""no, but.""  The only way to have separate loans is to refinance them one at a time, but if you make a large additional payment you can choose to either shorten the term of the loan  - OR - you can specify that you would like to maintain the length of the loan but reduce monthly payments.",4,1,StudentLoans,1045

mat1ix,"Refinance Student Loans for Shorter Term, or Overpay?","I'm really hoping you guys can shed some light and/or provide some advice on paying off student loans. Please forgive my ignorance here. I tried to do some searching on this sub (and r/personalfinance) but I didn't come up with a straight answer. I tried googling as well, but most of the posts are about lowering your payments, NOT about paying it off sooner.

Backstory:  I knew my fiancé had ""a lot"" of student debt, but we recently sat down and reviewed our finances and I was shocked to find that he has over $100K in student loans for his bachelor's degree. He's been paying on them for about 5 years already. About half of this is on a private loan through SoFi with a 20 year repayment. My questions focus around this loan.  


He has an offer to refinance and knock off a few percentage points. This makes sense to me, but after fooling around with the repayment tool, I realized that decreasing the repayment to 10 years only increases the payment by a few hundred dollars. That's totally doable with our combined income. However, cranking it down to a 5 year is only a few hundred more. Still doable.  
He brought up that we could refinance to a 10 year and just increase the payment by a few hundred extra and still pay it off in 5 years. This would protect us if we had an emergency (also, we plan to have kids in the next few years -- I'm older than him and waiting a few more years until his loans are paid down isn't a safe option  -- and we might regret committing to that higher payment when we're funding day care.   
Is there a downside to refinancing to a 10 year loan and paying at the 5 year rate?

I don't have student loans nor do I know a ton about debt. I have a car loan but I over pay on that, and I noticed that the overpayment just applies to the next payment, not to the principal, so I think that means I'm still paying the same amount of interest in the long run, just paying it early. I don't want to do the same thing on his loans.

mapuxf,US Dept. of ED streamlines Borrower Defense claim process," From [www.ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov) (see press releases)

Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced it will streamline debt relief determinations for borrowers with claims approved to date that their institution engaged in certain misconduct. The Department will be rescinding the formula for calculating partial relief and adopting a streamlined approach for granting full relief under the regulations to borrower defense claims approved to date. The Department anticipates this change will ultimately help approximately 72,000 borrowers receive $1 billion in loan cancellation.

“Borrowers deserve a simplified and fair path to relief when they have been harmed by their institution’s misconduct,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “A close review of these claims and the associated evidence showed these borrowers have been harmed and we will grant them a fresh start from their debt.”

Current provisions in federal law called ""borrower defense to repayment"" or ""borrower defense"" allow federal borrowers to seek cancellation of their William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans if their institution engaged in certain misconduct. Beginning today, the Department will ensure that borrowers with approved borrower defense claims to date will have a streamlined path to receiving full loan discharges. This includes borrowers with previously approved claims that received less than a full loan discharge.

Full relief under the regulations will include:

* 100 percent discharge of borrowers’ related federal student loans.
* Reimbursement of any amounts paid on the loans, where appropriate under the regulations.
* Requests to credit bureaus to remove any related negative credit reporting. And,
* Reinstatement of federal student aid eligibility, if applicable.",0,1,StudentLoans,1812

I'd be inclined to work on the ones that are normally highest interest, but right now they are at 0% due due to the pandemic. The others - all FFELP - are at a much lower rate; however, two of them are at variable interest rates. Do I work on reducing the balance of the current 0% ones so when we return to ""normal,"" they are less odious? Or do I work on the ones that are 2.43-3.25% and currently still accruing interest?

I was able to finish my first degree with very little debt but when I went back for a second degree (long story) I ended up really pilling the debt up. For those that might be unaware, the amount of public loans you qualify for when getting a second bachelor's degree decreases substantially and I implore everyone that if you really want a second bachelor's to try your best to get a double major before you graduate the first time.

Anyways, I still have a ways to go to clean up the public loan mess (about $35,000 right now), but paying off the private loan feels like a weight off my shoulders. Even though I should have been focusing on school at the time, the feeling of having so much debt gave me a lot of anxiety. In fact, I ended up not finishing and decided to just get a full time job which I ended up working myself into the job I was originally going back to school for (and now my employer is paying for me to finish).

The original loan was almost 10% interest so it almost might as well have been credit card debt. Thankfully after I got a job I refinanced and cut the rate in half, which did help in paying it off. Took about two years but those creditors will never get another penny from me and it feels pretty great.

Life lessons I would say to anyone who is considering going back for a second degree is you really need to do your homework about what kind of financial aid you will actually qualify for first. For example, because my second degree was pretty unrelated to my first degree, I didn't qualify for a dime of government loans until I had enough credits in the new program (CS). I probably should have done part time school and worked full time until I qualified for government assistance. While it's still student loan debt, it's lower interest and government loans are way more flexible for you life situation (income based repayments don't exist with private loans). Also, keep in mind that you don't get the pell grant if you did previously among other things. 

Finally, if you are in a degree program that you don't like and are thinking ""I might as well just finish and get another degree later"", think long and hard about if you should graduate. If the first degree is not going to help you get work it's worth considering not graduating until you have a long term life plan in place, especially if you decide to pivot to a different field.",11,131,StudentLoans,2475
m9mqft,"Help, what do we do next?","My husband graduated from college in 1999.  He consolidated into FFELP loans in 2001(?) sometime before we married.  There are now two FFELP loans (owned by Deutsche Bank with NYS Higher Ed listed as the guarantor), totaling just under 17k.  He's been teaching in a Title 1 school for 20 years, not that that matters.  I have no student loans, and have delayed finishing my degree in part because taking on more student loans is not something we can do.  I work part-time (could have been full-time by now, but COVID happened, so somebody had to oversee the kids' schooling).  


Repeated medical bills, occasional poor decision-making, growing family, and large minimum payments have kept us in deferment or forbearance with intermittent periods of IBR for years.  We are finally at a place where we can actually pay on them but are now in a place where the minimum payment is too damn high.  We can maybe swing half of it if we push it, but we do not seem to be eligible for any sort of refinancing or reduced payment.  


What can we do?  While frustrated and annoyed, we're not opposed to paying them if we can keep the payments manageable.  We literally just refinanced the house last month (which is what freed up the money to pay on the student loans), and Earnest and the like require a higher credit score than my husband has. Navient is only providing us the option of graduated payments with a minimum of $505.

I have federal loans that I am leaving alone. Currently taking master's part-time so all loans are deffered. I have/had 1 private loan with Wells Fargo at 12.5 for 10% fixed (Wells Fargo exiting student loans = auto transfer to someplace else). 
Currently the loan is up to 17k I've put in about 6k anf its only reduced by 1k over that time. THIS IS MAKES ME SO ANGRY. But that's life I guess. I want to refiance that loan with a lower fixed rate. It is co-signed with my parents who are fine if I remove the co-signature or not. 
I DO want to make roughly 2k payment before refinancing so less interest turns into principal.

m94165,Move in with my dad states away to pay loans or move to the city close to my job in my homestate?,"Hi guys, I am kind of going through a weird predicament here and I am struggling to make a decision. I am 24 years old almost 25 and I have the opportunity to live in the city Ive been wanting to live in (with a room mate of course) and although I feel like I should be ecstatic, I am wondering if it might be best for me to move in with my dad (who lives in a completely different state) and save up some money to pay off my debt. I am $25,000 in debt and I make 62,000/ year before taxes. I currently have about $9k in savings. If I moved out I would be paying $1200 rent including all possible utilities and about $200 on groceries every month. Bus pas would be about $55 a month so that makes all essential bills come out to about $1500/ month. My take home pay is about $3400 after taxes and 401k. (I contribute 8% and 6% gets matched). I also have about $20k in a ROTH IRA but I don’t know if I should touch this money and just pay off my student debt asap.

Anyways that brings me to about $1900 a month after all essential bills, I could technically just live like a hermit and just throw all the rest of my money at the loan but I don’t know what that would do for my mental health. If I stayed with my dad I would be very far away from my friends and boyfriend which could also affect my mental health. 

My job is not requiring anyone to come into the office  although we have the option to go in if we like. People from my team go in about 2 times a week but if I were to move I would be missing out on building in person relationships with them, or at-least putting that on hold for some time. I just started this job a month ago and its my first real job. If I wanted to save up to the amount that would pay all my student debt I would have to stay for about 7.5 months. 

These loans are federal if that matters. 

Also if I stayed with my dad I would have zero social life for the entirety of the 7 months. Missing out on spending my birthday with friends and essentially the entire summer.

I don’t know what to do and any advice would be helpful.

m8ohv7,Misleading Information on Forgiveness Plans (USA),"Recently, an article appeared on several news outlets lamenting how only 32 students received student loan forgiveness through income-driven repayment plans. Here’s a link to the article: https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/03/09/only-32-borrowers-have-ever-qualified-income-driven-repayment

Here’s the issue: Before 2009, the only income-driven repayment plan available was Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and ICR was only applicable to direct student loans, which comparatively few students qualified for at the time. ICR was implemented in 1994 or 1995 and is far less generous than newer income-driven repayment plans, like IBR, PAYE and REPAYE. 

ICR uses the one of these two criteria to determine monthly payments:

20% of your discretionary income divided by 12, with discretionary income for ICR purposes being defined as 100% of the federal poverty level

or

What you’d pay on a 12-year fixed repayment plan when adjusted for your income (I’m not sure what exactly this means or how the number is calculated)

The plan forgives any remaining balance after 25 years of qualifying payments. Therefore, being that ICR was implemented in the mid-1990s and charged a higher percentage of income for repayment purposes, I’m not at all surprised that so few people benefited from the forgiveness option, which would have only been available starting in 2019 or 2020. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that student loan balances drawn in the 90s were lower than today.

Over the next decade or so, student loan forgiveness per ICR, IBR, etc. will increase steadily as more people reach the time limit.",8,23,StudentLoans,1622

m8l8xn,Questions regarding a second bachelor degree seeking student who has never used loans,"Hi, all. I was wondering if anyone could provide some guidance as to how student loans work, especially for someone who has never touched loans. I graduated from college in 2018 with my BSN degree. Thankfully, with the amount of scholarships and grants that I was receiving, as well as living with my parents during my entire college career, I was able to pay things off debt free for my BSN. After a couple of years working as a nurse, I am considering going back to school and possibly getting a second bachelor's degree in clinical laboratory sciences. The school I was looking at, which is one of the very few in my state, offers a CLS program. The thing is, the price may require me to actually take out some student loans for the first time. 

My question(s) are as follows:

1) As a student who already holds a baccalaureate degree and who has received PELL Grant in the past, but never accepted any loans, would I still be eligible to receive student loans should I choose to seek a second baccalaureate degree?

2) When exactly should one apply for the FAFSA to determine eligibility for student loans? Would I have to wait til I am formally accepted into the program that I am applying for, or should I just do the FAFSA now, despite not waiting for an admission decision? 

3) Lastly, I know that some people have talked about loan forgiveness and not having to pay student loans right away. There is some sort of ""grace period"" or such. Would anyone care to please elaborate on this process and how this works?

m7tkzy,"ED Secretary Cardozo Repeals Awful ""partial relief"" rule put into place under Devos for borrowers defrauded by their schools","You guys - i am so happy!  The ED just issued a press release announcing the repeal of the draconian rule put into place under the last administration.  That rule created this pretty opaque partial discharge formula for borrowers whose borrower defense to repayment claims were approved.  I worked with many borrowers who received letters stating - congrats - we agree with you that your school defrauded you - based on our calculations - we've discharged 0% of your loans - yes - 0.  It was such an insult and just another example of the steps the prior administration went to to block relief for these defrauded borrowers.  

I'm pasting the text to the press release below - but if you were one of these borrowers my advice is to celebrate - but be patient.  There's tens of thousands of these borrowers and it will take a minute to sort this.  I don't expect you'll have to submit anything else - i do expect any refunds you might be owed to come from the servicer - but the servicer has no authority here so if it takes a few months - which it probably will - don't get blame them.  If you are an affected borrower i'd give it 90 days or so and if you don't hear anything reach out through the borrower defense portal.  If you are a borrower who has a pending claim - this announcement doesn't talk about those - but i would expect those to start moving finally as well - probably in the next six months or so - pure guess.

""Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced it will streamline debt relief determinations for borrowers with claims approved to date that their institution engaged in certain misconduct. The Department will be rescinding the formula for calculating partial relief and adopting a streamlined approach for granting full relief under the regulations to borrower defense claims approved to date. The Department anticipates this change will ultimately help approximately 72,000 borrowers receive $1 billion in loan cancellation.


“Borrowers deserve a simplified and fair path to relief when they have been harmed by their institution’s misconduct,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “A close review of these claims and the associated evidence showed these borrowers have been harmed and we will grant them a fresh start from their debt.”
Current provisions in federal law called ""borrower defense to repayment"" or ""borrower defense"" allow federal borrowers to seek cancellation of their William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans if their institution engaged in certain misconduct. Beginning today, the Department will ensure that borrowers with approved borrower defense claims to date will have a streamlined path to receiving full loan discharges. This includes borrowers with previously approved claims that received less than a full loan discharge.


Full relief under the regulations will include:
•	100 percent discharge of borrowers’ related federal student loans.
•	Reimbursement of any amounts paid on the loans, where appropriate under the regulations.
•	Requests to credit bureaus to remove any related negative credit reporting. And,
•	Reinstatement of federal student aid eligibility, if applicable.


This new approach replaces a methodology first announced in December 2019 to determine the amount of relief granted to borrowers with approved claims. After completing a comprehensive review of that methodology, the Department determined that it did not result in an appropriate relief determination.
This is the Department’s first step in addressing borrower defense claims as well as the underlying regulations. The Department will be pursuing additional actions, including re-regulation, in the future.
The Department will begin applying this new approach today and affected borrowers will receive notices from the Department over the next several weeks with discharges following after that. Updated information for borrowers will be posted to StudentAid.gov/borrower-defense.""",33,140,StudentLoans,3965

It’s been really hard because it’s our slow season at work now so I’m trying to be prudent but also ambitious. I keep track using a Debt Free Chart. One thing that also helped was laying out my entire financial goals for the next 3 years, which include paying off credit cards, saving for a big emergency fund, and a down payment.

After many years of very bad temp jobs, I finally got a decent job and paid about $600/month for close to 10 years, up until Covid. It seems I barely made a dent in them in 10 years, particularly because I skipped maybe one month per year due to medical or car expenses. 

Because my loans are FFEL and with Navient, I have not been eligible for the Covid deferments. However, I used forbearance and accrued interest over the last year in order to save up an emergency fund. (I have been extremely stupid about these loans. I did not think I was accruing interest this past year because I thought interest was suspended on all federal loans.)

My two loans are at 5.375% interest but a direct consolidation would put them at 5.5% interest. How bad is that increase if I'm going to try to pay these off in 10 years or less? Will the current deferment through September make this worthwhile, even if it takes 90 days for the consolidation to go through?(side note: I did a consolidation many years ago and I read somewhere you can only consolidate once so not sure if that applies to me or not.)

[studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) shows me at 86k principal with $4200 in accrued interest. If I have about $5k to throw at this problem right now (about 60% of my emergency fund), does it make sense to just pay that accrued interest now so it's not added to the principal?

tl;dr

1. Consolidate two 5.375% interest loans to a 5.5% Direct loan to take advantage of the current deferment for the last few months (the consolidation could take 90 days)
2. Accrued interest, is it best to pay recently accrued interest if I can?

I’ve looked at the different plans, and for all I can tell, I can’t “pick” my payment to be artificially high using the plans listed on my servicer/DoE website. I can do the repayment calculator on the DoE site and “pick” my monthly payment to be whatever I want or choose a payoff date. The calculator spits out the REPAYE plan with a monthly payment of $688-$767 and an apply for payment button below.

It took me about a year to realize that this program doesn't line up with what traditional software engineers do. It had a lot of filler classes and only went up to college algebra.

m640i5,Affording School Post-Transfer,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on this sub and possibly may not be my last. For the last two years, I've gone to community college in order to transfer to a state school. Now, I've gotten into 2 state schools that are local/commuter and 1 school which would be an hour and a half away; tuition is similar for all these schools (ranging from $6.8-7.5k a year). I am also majoring in Accounting and intend on getting my CPA after I get my bachelors, no doubt.

My parents refuse to pay for tuition (I just asked them for help with tuition) if I move away from home, which will inevitably be way more money for me in general. But, the stipulation is they'll pay for my schooling only if I stay home and go to school locally. If I stay home, my education is free because my parents are funding it, but if I leave, the cost will be approx. $40k for the last 2 years.

I don't mind the local schools I got into, but my home life is not ideal. I am 20 y/o and I am still sharing a room with 2 of my adult siblings. My family has lived in a small, two bedroom house my whole life (with 6 of us--parents + my siblings and I, but my oldest sister just moved out) in an apartment complex. I lack a LOT of privacy because my family and I are always holed up together. Another issue I have with my living arrangement is my lack of parking and, thus, freedom. Since we live in an apartment complex, my parents always make me save parking on the street, but because they're paranoid other cars will fill up the street before me, they never let me drive my car unless I have to (classes are okay, but they see clubs as a waste of time so I most likely wouldn't be able to join orgs to network and make friends like I want to). Another thing that's been stressing me out are my parents; it can be really toxic at home and my mom cares about me, but she's heavily depressed and unloads it on me which has affected me mentally since I was in high school and I want to be able to get away for just 2 years.

If I leave, I would be accumulating about $30k in loans and most likely just work part time to pay for expenses and such. I can see if what I'm saying sounds like a first world problem and I seem foolish for giving up free college, but it sounds tempting since I've already paid less than $1000 for 2 years of college and my home life ain't great.

m62ir8,Student loans aren't enough to pay for college - is this a sick joke?,"&gt;!Rant!&lt;

Recently learned that the total cost including meal plan, housing, tuition, and fees at the college I want to go to are $8,900 per semester. Two semesters/year = $17,800/year. Maximum federal loan amount is $12,500 per year. I see a lot of people on this sub saying that they're stressed about student loans, but shit, at least you were able to even get enough loans to pay for your education. I always thought the real challenge was deciding to take on the debt. Didn't realize another challenge would even be acquiring enough debt in the first place. My situation is the opposite. I WANT the debt. I want to take out a big loan so I can not worry about working some shitty part time job and juggling homework at the same time. I want to focus on college while I'm in college and work hard when I get a real, salaried job. Is this such a crazy concept? I'm pissed. Gonna look into private loans. Jesus dude, I always thought the hard part was paying OFF the debt (Which I am frugal and won't have a problem with that), not ACQUIRING it.

Edit: Currently getting no help from parents, getting my AS at a CC. I will be 23 so will be considered independent by the time I graduate from CC. Will be majoring in computer science. My credit score is 750. People say work during the summer, but that's a given for me. I already have to worry about covering rent, regardless of whether classes are in session or not. That's why I want a big loan, because I want to use the money from the loan to cover rent so I can actually give some space for doing schoolwork. Why even go to college if you're just gonna be running back and forth from work to class and spreading your energy so thin that you just suck at everything? Who in their right mind would sign up for that?

Takeaways: 

1. Avoid private loans. 

2.

m5vr1d,Interest rate increased,"My husbands loans are serviced by Nelnet and when we logged into them today his interest rates increased? Also, his loan groups changed from “A”, “B”, etc. to “AA”, “BB” etc. this also seems odd. Any insight on this?",5,2,StudentLoans,216
m5ux0u,Refinance immediately or snowball first?,"So I have roughly 80k in loans through Sallie Mae. Two of the loans are in the ballpark of 25-30k and the rest are about 3-5k each. The interest rates on all of them are absurd so I obviously am going to try to refinance them. 

Given my limited understanding, if your debt to income ratio is smaller, it’s easier to secure lower interest rates.
Would it be smarter to hold off on refinancing for a few months while I debt snowball some of the smaller loans? Or should I just get them all under one new loan and start hammering away at it?",4,4,StudentLoans,539
m5srrl,Student Loan for math masters,"A little bit about myself: I'll receive my undergraduate degree in mathematics in May 2021(from a place in India). I'm really passionate about mathematics and I eventually wish to obtain a Ph.D. I have an interest in Differential Geometry and I had applied to some places for graduate studies that specialize in this area.

I have received an offer for the M.A Mathematics program at Stony Brook (NY). Now Stony Brook, as far as I know, is a great place for mathematics and Differential Geometry; many top researchers in the area of Geometry are associated with that place. All this makes it an enticing offer for me. The main issue, as you might've guessed is that it's an expensive endeavor: according to my last calculations it'll cost me around 50k USD for two years. I've seen higher numbers on this group but still, I'm a bit unsure about proceeding with the offer. 

I just want to get some financial insight into this. I'm also open to career advice :)",3,5,StudentLoans,960
m5rj02,Repayment advice,"Hi everyone. I have about $115k in student loans from undergrad and getting my law degree. I currently work at a firm and make $75k per year.

I’m scared to jump ship on a good salary when I have so much in debt. Right now I’m paying the minimum each month and saving everything else for a small house with the same mortgage payment as I pay in rent right now.

m5nvv6,Can I build enough credit via credit card payments to qualify for private loans? Would becoming an independent help me qualify for more federal loans?,"I got a TA job for next semester but it’s only $2000 a semester. I also sell wholesale on the side but, I would not like to work anymore because I need to commit all my time to school and research, so I am looking for options other than a full time job. Aside from a full time job, the only option would be to take out private loans. However, I don’t have any credit built up.

Can I get a credit card now and build up enough credit to take out private loans? Do I need to have a job to get one? Additionally, would becoming an independent for tax purposes help me qualify for more loans?",8,2,StudentLoans,588
m5lnqs,Question about accepting loans and signing the MPN,"Greetings all.

&#x200B;

I need to accept the unsubsidized and graduate PLUS loans for a program (let's say school A) I have on my docket ASAP, or I risk missing the payment deadline and incurring late fees. I also have to sign the MPN as well as some of the other documents.

&#x200B;

In the meantime, I am waiting to hear back from a program I really like. I don't think I can wait until they get back to me before accepting the loans at school A, signing the MPN and the other documents, etc.

&#x200B;

My question is, if I do all of this for school A, and school B gets back to me with an acceptance/offer, what would happen then? Would I be completely screwed over at that point because I accepted the loans and signed the documentation?

&#x200B;

Any feedback would appreciated. Thank you!",2,2,StudentLoans,799
m5kzop,Finito,"3 Years after graduating I can finally say that I am debt free. 30k in 3 years. 40k/52k/72.5k salary progression.

1st year I only worked 5 months, took some time off to take classes for CPA fulfillment requirements. Still living at home.  No progress on loans

2nd year finally passed the exam who knows how many 1000's of dollars later, landed a big boy job and signed my first lease with a roommate the week before lockdown began. COVID meant no travelling, no weekends out, no extracurriculars which undoubtedly helped. Started throwing 1000-1500 payments at a time. Sometimes I would be up at 3am, see my paycheck hit and automatically send the money out.

3rd year:

Today, with the stimulus package, my net worth is somewhere around +500. Going to request payments made to fedloan back up to 10,000 to hold on to just in case there's forgiveness, because there is really no downside.

Plans for the future. Double my salary within the next year. Find more fulfilling work. My biggest problem personally now is boredom and unfulfillment. But luckily without the shackles of debt, I am a little free-er to explore the possibilities. Honestly I'm looking forward to living in the moment a little more.

If I could do it all over again, I would work harder in school. Double Major in Mech E and Business. The loans would not have been such a big issue if I was more interested in my work, or if I had a healthier social life or if I had any sense of what the hell I wanted to do with my life. But there are reasons why I made all the decisions that I made, and each of them taught me something, so here's to the future which seems like an open road. One of the biggest lessons is that everything is a grind. Life is a grind. Learn to appreciate the little moments. When I had no job, no prospects and no life, I always found a moment I could be thankful for- for example having a warm cup of coffee before studying. If I had to give loan advice I would say, limit total loans to 50% of the low salary end of your dream job. I don't regret the loans, I regret not maximizing loan value by utilizing my time in the best way.

I'd like to thank my parents for letting me live at home rent free that first year. All the jobs who took a chance on me.  Dave Ramsey who was there for me in the morning and at night and whenever I needed some reassurance. I don't believe in god but I'd like to thank the universe for blessing me with health, the opportunity to grow, consequences for my dumb decisions, oh and also for my pure dumb luck of being an american citizen and living in the most opportunity rich country on the planet.

Good luck to everybody. I wish you all the best on your journey,",18,134,StudentLoans,2690
m5gvk9,Unexpected Student Debt in Australia," 

Hello  everyone in this sub!! I am a US citizen, but a few years ago I had a  chance to study abroad in Australia. Due to some personal reasons, I  dropped out and moved out of Australia. Recently, I received an email  from my old university and its creditor saying that I still have a  tuition debt that needs to be paid, and the amount is equal to the  tuition of a full time student in one term.

I  am really surprised because I am certain that I already submitted a  request to discontinue my course before the starting day of that term.  Also, I have not come back to Australia since the day I moved out.

What  should I do in this situation before contacting the school? I remember  an advice that I should not contact the creditor before receiving proper  advice, so that's why I come here today.

Thanks a lot.",8,2,StudentLoans,822
m5hiz0,Sallie Mae lump sum payment & auto debit,"Hi all, 

I was FINALLY able to refinance but the largest refinance loan I could get was 99,999. So, I paid off a lump sum $6000 payment. I then removed all my bank accounts from sallie Mae. Then 4 days ago received confirmation that Earnest, my new provider, sent along the payments to sallie Mae. I just woke up to see that Sallie Mae charged me $1300 auto debit anyway. Is there a chance I can get the money back from sallie Mae? Or can I block it on chase’s side and get my money back. Luckily for me I will never have to deal with Sallie Mae again so okay with blocking them forever.",5,19,StudentLoans,588
m5dac0,Wells Fargo to Firstmark,"On March 20, 2021 Wells Fargo will transfer my loans to Firstmark. I have a few questions about this process. 


-Currently my loans are automatically drafted from a separate bank. Would I have to set up automatic payments before the date I have set with Wells Fargo? (12th of each month).


-This may sound like a silly question, but will an account be created on my behalf or will I have to create my own account and link it to my loans transferred from Wells Fargo?",4,4,StudentLoans,468
m5cxpy,Still in college - can I lower my interest rate?,"I’m currently still a college student, expected to graduate in about 1.5 years. I took out a loan for my freshmen year through SunTrust and just signed up for the AES to monitor it. Turns out this loan has been accruing for 9%. This seems incredibly high and I admit that as a freshmen I wasn’t paying much attention to the rate and how much the loan can stack up. 

However I’m wondering if there’s anyway I can lower this rate right now? I know the rate goes down a bit on proof of graduation, and maybe I can negotiate based on my salary post graduation. But as a college student still, what resources can I tap into? Thanks",1,1,StudentLoans,627
m5artn,Should I start paying off loans now?,"Hey everyone! So I have about 23k in federal loans from nursing school. Right now, they are in forbearance due to the Covid relief legislation. However, my question is, should I start chipping away at them while it’s interest free?

A few random things to note:

• I currently work for an employer that will pay off my loans if I stay here for 3 years. They pay 21% after 1 year of employment, 29% after two years, and the remaining 50% after three years. I definitely am going to do a year here but I’m not sure if I want to do much more after that. Also a catch to this is I still have to be making payments in between. My employer only gives lump sum checks at the end of each year. 

• I have a decent emergency savings account. Enough to cover about 6 months of expenses should I lose my job. I could realistically afford to pay $2-300/month without dipping into my savings. 

Bottom line is I want financial freedom and to be debt free as soon as possible. But is it wiser for me to just save my money while we have this temporary hold on student loans then let my employer pay over the course of three years?

I appreciate any and all input! Thanks in advance!",17,7,StudentLoans,1167
